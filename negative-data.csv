i wont go here again the service was very slow and some of our food came cold  i had the shrimp from the appetizer menu and didnt feel good the rest of the night  this is definitely a miss
i stopped at this place because they had a sign out front that said free free free  can of soda and a bag of chips with sandwich or platter purchase  ok  it got me  so i went in  ordered a sandwich  grabbed a small bag of chips off the shelf and a can of soda and went to the register  to my surprise  it rung up at 11  when i questioned the man he said the chips i had didnt count  i needed the secret crappy chips they had hidden behind the counter  ok  so then my total was still 880  oh  only the chips or the soda is included  not both  and btw  it clearly says and a bag of chips see photos  so i gave the chips back and said i just wanted the soda so he mumbled a new price i couldnt really hear and ran my card  i had to ask for the receipt and just shoved it in my pocket  so i get home and realize the receipt is for 880  really  shouldve taken those stupid chips  what a ripoff  and i check the reviews to find out that ripping people off is a normal business practice of theirs  only those reviews are conveniently filtered  did you know if you scroll down the bottom where it says 1 through x of x that there is a link to see reviews that have been filtered out  if you didnt you probably still dont  because i imagine my review will be filtered too  update i went back to the establishment to complain and they claimed the extra charge was not for the soda andor chips  but rather because i got my sandwich on a roll  like the other reviewer  the guy behind the counter offered it to me on a roll and i said fine i was never informed of the extra charge  but instead of apologizing for the confusion he offered to let me take the advertised bag of chips
not sure what its like now  but was my favorite as an undergrad pizza was the best on campus salads were enormous   but honestly everyone should try to avoid it because they still dont use normal plats and silverware everything is disposable and for a school that takes a lot of pride in its greenness  thats pretty ridiculous
wings etc recently opened up down the road from where i live  which made me excited to have a sports bar where i could catch a game with some hopefully tasty food and cold beer its a chain regional to the midwest and seems to have somewhat of a following  so what the heck  i went with coworkers on two occasions one  which i will briefly touch on  was to conquer their wall of flame challenge which involved eating 16 crazy hot wings with no food or drink success at the sacrifice of all taste for the next day worth it well  i did get a free tshirt  back to wings having worked in restaurants for a decent part of my life  i am critical when it comes to service  im not a jerk by any means  and i understand the concept of being busy  but there should be a good line of communication between staff and customer wings etc does not have this we waited 10 minutes for our waitress  15 minutes for our drinks  30 minutes for our food  and then 20 minutes more for her to bring us the check and then run our credit cards thats just not acceptable and the second time i went back  the service was just as bad not friendly  and way too long  as for the food  its ok the boneless wings are cooked to death so you get crusty nuggets and the traditional wings are a bit big because they are jumbo and have a large skin pocket on them that does not cook very well  leaving you with a flabby  fatty wing to eat the sauces are ok  much thicker than any other wing place i have been to  and most seem to have a tomato base so the sauce does not really stick to the wing  meaning the wings are a bit bland the fries they make are very tasty  but thats pretty much all i found enjoyable about the experience so sadly i will have to travel further down the road if i want chicken wings or a football game  because this place is just not working out
bluefin bistro looks nice on the inside it has a great decor  that is the only good thing about this restaurant  i used to work in downtown lafayette  and one day the office decided to try it out  derailing ourselves from the most sacred taco tuesday at chumleys it took us about 30 minutes to be acknowledged for drinks by a ditzy waitress in a skintight uniform my water glass had a lipstick ring on it the cocktails are outrageously expensive for lafayette at lunchtime   upon ordering a lunch special  my seafood bisque came out with a giant piece of plastic in it it was obviously from the bag that the soup came in our ditzy waitress laughed it off  took my bowl  and never brought me another the sushi was marginal at best  my roll was falling apart  and the bento box seemed to have dried teriyaki sauce in it from another unfortunte victim of bluefin   when the meal was over  i was presented with a check for full price the manager was nowhere to be found to complain about the atrocious service and sanitary practices  or how many times our waitress said oooooops and laughed it off i will never go to bluefin again
visit 1  food poisoned visit 2  food poisoned  two other friends visits food poisoning galore  does anyone see a pattern here  on a side note  ive only been food poisoned by cheese steak places in my entire life despite loving cheese steaks to death 
i learned just today that the guy who owns the place kills wild animals for sport  leopards  elephants  bears  and other beautiful endangered animals on safari  truly disgusting  hes proud and brags about what he kills  and posts pictures everywhere of his trophies    httpwwwfacebookcomboycottjimmyjohns  oh yeah  the food is terrible  overprocessed ingredients and tasteless  like owner  like food  i suppose
well  theres good badfood and theres bad badfood  this is the worst of badfood  the lowest quality food possible  while i like a good greasy spoon diner  this place is just horrible  absolutely gross  gave them the benefit of the doubt and went twice  but its a thumbs down from me  if youre 20 and very drunk at 3 am  maybe otherwise  stay away and keep an artery open
food is only so so  making shepherds pie with beef betrays the inauthentic nature of the place   call it cottage pie or make it with lamb only  service was terrible  my friends and i will not be going back
im not sure what else i can say about frogro that hasnt been said in summary  weird layout  incredibly inflated prices  rotting food  perpetually angry staff  the only plus  though  is that its open 247  which is convenient for us college students in university city if you need something during normal waking hours  though  and you have transportation  please make the trip to whole foods or trader joes  for your own good
i came in here and politely ordered the banana with yogurt i asked if i could add granola  offering to pay for the extra item the guy at the counter  with brown hair and glasses  flat out told me no  we cant do that you have to get the other one the other one had berries  and i didnt want berries he told me again  that there was no way for me to get granola added to my dish which is exactly the same thing only without berries um  ok totally rude  its not that i was asking for something extravagant  luxurious or even unreasonableits granola   the coffee smells and tastes burnt  and the internet was so bad that i had to connect to starbucks internet   not worth high prices and snobby lack of service
im a loyal customer of green house and it seems that the owner has been changed recently  the number of side dishes has decreased largely i only got four dishes and they came with very little amount we had two people dined in  the tv was not on the previous owner definitely wouldnt allow this to happen their tv is a big attraction for their customers   steam rice used to come with large amount now its likeflat  disappointing your stars will be decreasing more if you try to save more money on these details
why is everyone raving about this place i ate there once  my first year in town  and have never gone back because i had such a terrible meal  fast and cheap  sure  but also tasteless  i recall eating something that tasted like veggies with gloppy brown sauce on it  it was served in styrofoam with a matted and mushy blob of white rice  maybe im missing something  but i was deeply disappointed
go here only if you absolutely have to and i doubt you do
okay  i say as i write this  cut them some slack  theyve just opened and theyre calling it a soft opening  trust me  it dont get any softer than this   first  if you think youre going to a real jewish deli  forget it  nyc its not it was bigger in space than i expected but feels more like a college cafeteria than deli   there is no ambience at all just a bunch of people running around without a sense of what they are doing  heres a breakdown of lunch  i had a lunch companion with me  you get seated and then the wait begins finally a waitperson comes up and takes your beverage order then you wait then someone brings you a plate of pickles and a pickled tomato  the bright neon green pickles taste as if theyve barely been brined more like a dunked cucumber  the dark green pickles are so brined your mouth puckers as you injest copious amounts of salt and garlic  forget the tomato  hard as rock and sour   you wait until someone finally comes and takes your order  they tell you up front it will take a while for the food to arrive because  after all  this is a soft opening  but 45 minutes for a corned beef sandwich and burger the corn beef was so fatty i sent it back  it was pure tee nasty and the waiter  who was from nyc  agreed with me the burger was okay  but the meat left a greasy taste in my companions mouth the potato salad had no flavor whatsoever and the potatoes were barely cooked  inedible the slaw had no seasoning either just cabbage  mayo  a little vinegar i think  and watery the buns on the burgers were monster size bigger than the burger itself and there was no way to compress it down to bite into it  so off came the bun and the burger was eaten as just meat on a plate you are served in picnic plastic baskets wplastic utensils  maybe that will change later  one can only hope so they are currently giving customers 50 off on all orders but they could give me 100 off and i wouldnt go back  i had so much hope for this place  i couldnt wait for it to open  i actually went to stams next door for a piece of chocolate to remove the greasy taste from my mouth  theyre much nicer in there as well  so  fellow yelpers  if you go to streets i wish you well  but if you are looking for real jewish deli food youre going to be disappointed    when the manager is asking me what whitefish is and how to prepare it you  feel as if youve entered the twilight zone
we went on feb 15th at around 845 pm it was very noisy  crowded  packed but the food was sized appropriately we had a salad dishhuge  and chicken burger with fries    which came to around 25 including taxes and tips  we will not go there again because there were way too many tvs  we counted about 28 tvs in all  blasting away about every sporting event going on its a sports freaks heaven  not for us we didnt expect to have tvs blaring away during a meal  its either one or the other  its even uncomfortable thinking about it now  it was just too unpleasant the service felt more like an auction since no one was focused on making patrons feel comfortable meal times are to be enjoyed  not surrounded by tvs will not go there again even if someone paid us its not worth the money
i went here for a work event recently  and all i can say is never again granted we had a large party  about 20  but wed called ahead we had one server for 20 people  and clearly she was out of her element three of the first eight orders brought out were wrong the food came out staggered  one woman got her salad  and then ten minutes later we got our appetizer  and ten minutes after that we started getting the rest of the food my fries were ice cold theyd obviously been sitting for some time the guy who asked for no cheese because he was allergic got cheese  returned the sandwich and didnt see it again until we were ready to close out our bill over half an hour later more importantly on a party of 20 i know they were charging gratuity we could not beg for drink refills  which was stupid on her part because most in my party were drinking beers or mixed drinks and before you think it was a rowdy bunch  it was my companies quarterly finance meeting  all accountants with an average age of 45 so our rowdy days are over it was so bad i was embarrassed and i didnt pick the place
never  never  never  never again  heres why  the beef taco was very dry way too much salad on top  so i had no idea what type of taco i was eating poor customer service pricey  gave my bf and i a bad tummyache  overall i want my money back
yikes even just walking by here you can get the vibe sketchy dive bar in the udistrict if youre into that sort of thing  it might be fun
i came here looking for real sushi i assumed that given the prices  the fish would be fresh and the rice prepared correctly this is not the place to go if you want that  the nigiri was terrible the rice was gummy and poorly seasoned the fish was not fresh and was cut ridiculously thin in fact the mackerel was just plain horrible the rolls werent much better  but then again im not a fan of ridiculously overstuffed and over the top rolls this place just isnt for me i guess  the price is on par with other overpriced sushi restaurants i dont mind paying more for good sushi  but i just didnt feel what i was served warranted the price tag  im sure the drinks are great  im sure its a great place to be seen  im sure the free sushi on wednesdays is free but for well prepared sushi  this is not the place to come  not recommended
after 91 years in business  princetons five star restaurant closed on friday  november 19th  three generations have managed this illustrious restaurant  which has feted stars and sweetsixteen parties alike  however  the world moves on  and after the building was sold to an investment firm  ml seven  owner joe christen decided it was time for him to move on as well  leaving this location empty for the foreseeable future  mr siegel  as president of ml seven  do you think you have enriched the community
arrgghhhh i cannot believe it has come to this  im at a hooters and now that im here  i really cannot say why  except for a lack of options  and an excessively polyanna attitude  definitely  laziness and weather trumped the desire for excellence tonight  i do profess that i entered here with high hopes  but now i find that expectation excessively naive  beer first off  the beer selection is lousy especially bad considering the spirit of the times  when even the corner pub has craft beers on tap  and the food is pedestrian want to know what ales are on tap  expect a complete recitation of all draft beers  after all  ale and lager are just synonyms for beer  right  staff hooters claim to fame  of course  has historically been the waitresses god luvem  but i just dont care  delightfully tacky long ago became just plain tacky  the costumes are just plain ugly  from the support hose  the dirty white tennis shoes  the stretchedout socks  and the bulletproof bras  there is just nothing appealing about them  now  i will not paint the entire waitstaff with the same brush  but i do see a preponderance of pregnant substanceabuse victims here   to be fair  my waitress  tonight was attentive and friendly  even though she did flip out on the ale vs lager question  and then tried to convince me about what a great bartender she was the worst part was that when she was leaving and closing out my check  she threw away the charge detail  which meant that i could not expense the dinner company rules require a charge detail when i pressed her for it  she got quite snotty  and attempted to explain that in order to retrieve it she would have to dig through the garbage for it and i do not have to tell you what an obviously outlandish idea that was importantly  this occurred after i had written the bulk of this review  so her attitude did not really affect this  food the food is great  as long a you like it deep fried  and are not too picky as to things like flavor  visual appeal  or what sort of animal you are eating while previously known for their wings  these wings were just plain boring the hot sauce was hot without taste  and the chicken was stringy blecch  how can you go so wrong with chicken wings  positives  searching searching hold on a bit  still searching well  the beer was cold and you can be sure to get any beer you want  as long as you want bud  bud light  or coors light  and talk about inventiveness  who knew that you could construct most of a bar out of recycled plumbing equipment  there was free wifi  but the signal was so weak i connected to a hotspot from a neighboring establishment  specials kids eat free on saturdays seriously  its like a school sponsoring take a gun to class day  final assessment please  spare yourself  methinks definitely not
this is not for the restaurant     we came here on a thursday night at the suggestion of someone that lives there  there was a nice crowd there but not really that packed  thats to be expected on a thursday  however  the people that were there were lame  lame lame lame    there is no real dance floorso as we are walking by  to get to the bar  we have to squeeze past a bunch of chicks in spandex and lycra blend rainbowwet sealbody central club fits on  all dancing with each other and one random dude in the middle  take away one star for that  we get to the bar and i order 3 washington apples  the bartender takes down 3 mouthwash sized wax dixie cupsi was thinking to myself  he must be giving me a sample  when he set them shots in front of me and said 33 dollars  for washington apples in a wax mouthwash cup  when i woke up from faintingi made sure that i told him a place with this reputation should not be serving drinks in wax cups  the most fun we had was taking pictures in the globe chairs they have  horrible  we shouldve went to 10 pins  geisha house gets a huge fail
made us wait for 10 minutes to get a patio table  there was no one else waiting and 3 free tables  i figured they were going to make us wait a couple of minutes since being bitchy is their thing  but we actually had to wait 10 minutes  lame
this is the worst thai restaurant ive ever been to the food is horrible and the service is also horrible  the place is packed  over crowded  noisy  and with very little room  the dishes are all the same  tasteless and lacking texture  needless to say since it is in princeton  it is grossly overpriced
there are so many things that are wrong with blondies  the available seating is pretty weak because if you are traveling with a group you are essentially condemned to sit at a table that will intersect with the lines waiting for the cashier or their pizzas so for groups you pretty much have to choose carryout if you are eating alone then have fun sitting at one of the bar stools staring at a wall     the biggest travesty is how weak blondies pizza is the ratio of sauce  cheese  and dough is a delicate thing in pizza blondie fucks it up on so many levels i think its a combination of the shittylowquality ingredients and not enough sauce andor cheese the dough tastes really bad and theres too much dough and not baked enoughhonestly  i do not understand how people can keep on subsidizing this shit especially when better options cheeseboards  la vals  etc exist   avoid
if you want box cupcakes with store bought frosting at 250 a pop served with a crap attitude this place is for you   if you like let downs for a sweet treat this place is also for you   if you want a great cupcake experience like magnolia or something similar to nyc i would recommend searching elsewhere  cause you aint gonna find it here  my friends and i sampled 6 cupcakes and are happy to report we will increase our savings rate by not spending money on cupcakes in princeton  if youre the owner reading this review stop skimping on your product and make great quality cupcakes with love and flavor and employee someone that cares to describe whats behind the counter to the customer  first time in my life ive thrown away cupcakes
the food is actually pretty good and cheap   but because your service sucked so much ass tonight that i left  im bringing you down  le petit cheval   im the antientitlted american  and so for me to call out a place for bad service means there was some baaaad service baaaaad
for 8 bucks i got a sub par philly steak the bread was weird with its soft texture the meat was not all that good i had to slather hot sauce over it to make it bearable plus they told me i needed a coupon to get the deal there were advertising i do not think this place will last long but i may come back to try their jersey combo sandwich should the right situation come along
worst chipotle i have ever been to horrible service  very stingy workers  lard in my barbacoa  and to top it off  two of the top avocado seeds in my guac  go down kirby to main for the best chipotle under the sun  dont waste ur time  money here
so overrated all the hype  to which the place doesnt really live up to  first of all  what kind of burger place serve their customer their burgers with soggybuns opening the wrapper within 5 min of leaving the shop  we came across with  quite mediocre  soggy  and allaround disappointing burgers  i didnt really think there was anything outstanding about it ok yes  its maybe just slightly better than mcdonalds but wow  the difference is really paperthin    my son  reading this review  exclaimed what i think mcdonalds better  he couldnt finish the burger  this is a telltale sign of failure but i give it that fg is ever so slightly healthier than mcdonald   i also should mention that  whoever packed our bag  put the fries in a cup upside down  well  thank you  a nice touch  i think glenwood pines restaurant by taughannock falls serves a burger x15 times better than this one  and the price is not all that different  as i remember   and potatoes from idaho cmon  that sounds so fresh  local and sustainable  that this sound enticing to most people with poisoned mind  is the problem of the  world today we need to all think about   the cashier and the guy who handed me the burger were young parttimers  just like mcdonalds  i find them sort of rude  especially the guy  when he refused to take my receipt since i didnt need it any more i also wonder if the same guy put our fries upside down  thumbs down all the way
i got a grilled veggie panini like sandwich here not too long ago the veggies had that distinct  yet not so classic freezerburnt taste and smell  and were still a little cold in the middle they must have been seriously frozen in some cantabrigian tundra so as to still have an aroma of freezer burn even after being grilled it also took them like 15 minutes to make it that might have been ok if some chopping of fresh veggies was part of the prep  but grabbing a handful from the freezer to put on some bread really shouldnt take that long on second thought  it probably took a while to mostly thaw them  so that probably explains it the coffee is nothing special  your average grocery store brew  and the creamsugar area is always a crazy mess might suffice as an excellent hand warmer though  their sweets and pastries looked delicious  but not having tried them  i cant comment on them
one of the few times i wish that yelp offered a 0 star rating choice ive been twice to this location and can say  without a doubt  that this is the worst restaurant i have ever eaten at first visit food poisoning had to jump off the subway and run to the closest possible restroom second visit two separate hairs two in my food as in ordered food  found a hair  sent it back  got a new order  found another hair  never again this place is filthy and disgusting
ive tried the organic karat carrot cupcake and cappucino cupcake yes ive been there twice despite my low review  the second time because i wanted it to be good so bad haha  but no  they continue to disappoint the cake is dryy and the frosting is way too sweet and strangely dry since when can frosting be dry terrible cupcakes
wtf a terrible ending to a terrible visit to the worst city ive ever been in i went to philly for a college visit  which by the way im definately not attending because i hate philly it was my first time there   i was starving because i hadnt eaten all day and every food place i saw looked like greasy crappy philly cheesesteakesque foods i saw this place  recently renamed kiwi yogurt or something  and i also  being from new york  assumed it was a pinkberryred mango type thing now i love pinkberry but this was the worst piece of shit ever i dont know what it was  it wasnt even yogurt the part that pissed me off the most is the fact that it was so expensive  even though i only put a few toppings on  a small serving of yogurt it came out to 10 when it was weighed are you kidding me 10 for yogurt  literally i was like what the fuck in front of the cashier  but obviously i had to pay and then two other newbies came in and unknowingly loaded up their cups because im sure they assumed 49 cents per ounce was really cheap well theirs ended up to be 15 fifteen bucks per cup   this place is a complete ripoff and for the same amount you can get at pinkberry  you get a cup of dung for three times the price wowww philly
so my omelette was oozing with oil  my hash browns had what was either  clothing fiber or cat fur completely cooked into them and my supposedly awesome root beer was watered down and warmish despite the stupid frosty mug  to their credit they subtracted my meal from the bill  which is cool because i couldnt eat or drink it  but my friends peanut butter burger looked pretty awesome  even if he was disappointed with his shake  would it hurt the cook to wash his hair
this is honestly the worst starbucks i have ever been to hands down  and for some reason i always am willing to give them another chance i think well its rush hour and i may be able to get a drink here a little bit quicker than down the street at crema or i dont have any cash on me so i have to go somewhere that takes cards so i pop into starbucks for a lattealways a huge mistake  i have never been in and out of here in less than 15 minutes even when there isnt a line which is honestly ridiculous considering i can get a drink at the central square starbucks in less than 5 minutes with 10 people in line in front of me there have also been times when they have forgotten that i ordered a drink even though im the only one standing around waiting for one and ive also been outright ignored by two people standing at the cash registers they were too busy talking with each other to acknowledge me and i just had to walk out   if you need starbucks in harvard square  the one in the garage is much better and crema cafe is just around the corner but dont waste your time with this starbucks i wont ever again
this places ice cream pales in comparison to that which you can get at jp licks and christinas ice cream shop  cheap tasting ingredients
i have no idea why people give this place good reviews there is absolutely nothing special about theloniuss rolls besides perhaps the clever names they give them in their menu the rice is not cooked well as in  i believe it was overcooked  their ingredients are not fresh  and the service isnt great service was slow when we got there we also tried their miso soup which wasnt even good  it had a slightly sweeter taste  which was bizarre and really  how can you even mess up miso soup   lastly  it is clear the owner of this restaurant cannot handle the criticism and asks his friends to actively berate and bully yelp users who attempt to provide their opinion of the restaurant ex a yelp user messaged me with youre fat her first review on yelp thelonious monkfish  five stars listen  it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure that one out
i got here through buywithme  10 for 20 voucher  the waffles i was very disappointed with the quality of the waffles  and ive definitely had better they were extremely doughey  heavy  chewy  and one of them was slightly raw in the center the size of the waffles was also disappointing  im a small girl  but even i had to eat at least 15 waffles to feel full  the service slow hectic loud rude because the size of the space and the great number of customers pouring in  they want to ensure that you dont idle too long at your table once you are done with your meal which is fine but whisking away plates and utensils that you are still using is not fine  and it made me uncomfortable and pressured me to eat my meal faster  the management rude yells at their employees i understand that dealing with a lot of customer traffic can get overwhelming  but they didnt know how to handle it professionally and calmly  the price overpriced not an improvement from the creperie that once occupied this space  the only good thing the decor wasnt so bad i really liked some of their fancy cushioned chairs they had  very european wasnt a fan of the metal chairs though
i know one place i will not be returning to when i visit our rpi guy  unless im coming to watch a swing or tango  i really have no reason to return  i checked in with my fellow yelpers upon hearing our sons recommendation and made a reservation to enjoy what he felt were great drinks and memorable bruschetta assuming the food would follow suit  the martini was a disaster  his gin and tonic was tonic infused with gin  and we had the worst prime rib and mashed potatoes ever  do not bother to order the carbonara  unless you enjoy pasta cooked al chef boyardee mush and obnoxious amounts of cream  its more a mush meets alfredo and had a bad date  interesting architecture  boring service and food that quite frankly wasnt worth the paper our bill was printed on  save yourself some dead presidents and order pizza in or just go dancing  stick with water  and get your high somewhere else in town
great bartender  wonderful but horrendously overpriced wine list  i have to say  we didnt stay for dinner and went over to temple downtown after trying the worst carpaccio ive had in a long time  they over populated the dish with arugula  shaved parmesano reggiano was ausente  but my goodness heavens  they freeze and defrost the meat and it has a bland spongy texture  yuck  shame on such a beautiful restaurant with a nice little bar with personality  shame on you
the most overpriced  undersized burger youll ever eat  the only reason its not the crappiest burger youve ever eaten is the sauce they put on it  they could put it on an old sock and it wouldnt taste half bad  theres plenty of greasy burgers in la  and a person shouldnt be forced to fork over 12 bucks for a meal that has a worse chance of being delicious than the jonas brothers do of being considered real musicians  shouldnt the prices be less since its old  theyve got the nostalgia market cornered but continue to price their food like its on sunset  too small  too mediocre  too expensive  and too ridiculous to even consider if youre not a retired investment banker
not so good noodles were over cooked and pad thai very sweet
i have no idea why this place is still open its a total dump the only people who get treated like humans here are arabs and persians i am not being racist at all i saw it with my own eyes i have been here on two separate occasions with some friends   i dont even know where to begin  a there is a minimum limit per person charge i believe its 20  bthe furniture is falling apart there are burns in the furniture from cigarette ashes and food stains  cthe floor is filthy and sticky   dthe restroom is filthier than a restroom at a truck stop  e the wait time for a hookah and or food is ridiculous  well that is unless your of middle eastern descent i witnessed this four times we had persian kids come way after us and they had there hummus and drinks two minutes after they sat down we waited 30 minutes just for hummus and water  and they forgot the pita bread agh  f the staff and owner are a bunch of greasy slick guidos they overcharged my friends card and left it back at the register while we signed the bill  g when the food actually arrived it tasted horrible my friend and i shared a dish we only had two bites and left  h the hookah tasted horrible it was to harsh and flavorless  i i doubt they thourghly clean the hookahs if they cant even clean the floors i doubt they clean the hookahs    if you want good hookah go across the street i dont remember the name  but its next to diddy riese    so enter at your own risk
i had eaten here once of twice when i visited friends in la years ago i dont remember what the food was like  but liked the oldschool decor and its 24hour service   apparently years later  when i visited again as a sober being in the day light  the experience is entirely different my husband and i wanted to get something to go before we head back to sf we both got the egg sandwich  the cheapest thing on the menu  which were like ten bucks each i dont think any breakfast item price should exceed a single digit unless i am eating crab buffet in a posh hotel listening to live jazz   but anyway  price inflationwe are in 2009everything is more expensiveblahblahblah we did exit the restaurant with two hefty boxes that would sure keep our bellies full for the next 8 hours   unfortunately  the sandwiches sucked i couldnt tell the ham from the french roll to the cheese to the scrambled eggs it was just a blob of grease and the giant portion of potatoes tasted just as oily and gross   i dont get it  being in westwood  a college town  where cheap good food should be abundant  who do they sell such expensive bad food to
this place is for pseudo intellectuals  trying to get laid  but too smug to show 1 of interest in anything that contains a molecule  it takes forever to get a drink  its expensive  there is always an abomination of a band playing  which usually consists of a dude with a giant beard  a tambourine  a homemade noise machine  and an acoustic guitar  apparently vegetarians come here to eat the horse shit they call food god this place blows  i came here and suddenly was overwhelmed with the urge to drink extra dirty vodka martinis  what kind of prick drinks that shit come here for one reason  to come to the realization that you are in fact an uneducated  poorly dressed scum bag  and thank fucking god  now lets go to god damned characters in pomona
several friends recommended this place to me as having great seafood  so i had to try it out  i ordered oysters  and grilled trout and my companion ordered 12lb lobster lazy man style  this place gets 0 stars for food and 5 stars for ambiance  i averaged it out to 1 stars because the poor quality of the food outweighs the lovely setting of the restuarant  to start with the ambiance  they have great outdoor seating in the summer and live music  its a great place to kick back  have a drink with friends  and just enjoy the summer days   moving on to food  the reason that this place gets 0 stars in my book is because my companion and i started out with oysters as our appetizer  they were nicely presented and our waiter was really great at explaining the differences between oysters from different ports  etc  however  5 hours later that night  both my companion and i were retching over the toilet throwing up from the food  it was terrible and i wouldve expected a nice restuarant like hemenways to have cleaned out their seafood better    i called the place the next day to complain about the food and how it made me sick up all night throwing up with an uneasy stomach and the person i talked to on the phone basically shrugged us off and kept bouncing us from person to person  all in all  i did not get any apology or even an awknowledgement that our opinions valued
epic fail  yesterday  i looked at the reviews and decided to post a fourstar review  as i headed over to zorbas to meet a few outoftown friends why such a bad rap i thought  and figured id help boost the reviews of this place that id been to twice before  and enjoyed  well  i went there yesterday for lunch today  i woke up deathly ill  and proceeded to kick off 2010 by vomiting nice  im still sick but my family is taking care of me the three of us had different items  not sure what took us all down  but we suspect zorbas as we all went our separate ways and are all deathly ill today  now i will add that im sure they run a good business and are decent people but food poisoning is the one thing that cannot happen when you run a restaurant i will touch base with them to see if they will do anything for us
moonstruck is definitely not my cup of tea the prices are outrageous  the selection is not great  and they are probably the only coffeehouse type place that does not have wifi by now it is just too snooty for the common student looking to get a beverage or something sweet  oh and as i type this  i just remembered that the last time i was pulled in there by my fiancee because she had to have something sweet i went to sit down in one of the big chairs to wait for her and there was melted chocolate all over it not cool
for the 1000s that forward my reviews  ok  one  you know i consider a good restaurant is a place with a good bar food is relevant only if free during happy hours i left work early and ended up at the outdoor bar at legal at the charles hotel what a great day  and there was a hottie at the other side of the bar that made it even better i got a beer to start my long stay then it happened  the bartender started first  yelling for tommy  that must have been in china then singing way too loud to the music playing with the itouchthen commenting to everyone else working there on   omg another stoli  oh god  i made sooo many of these last night  blah blah blah limp joints that seemed to flap in the breeze ok  i am not homophobic  but look  this bar is not a set for a drag musical it is a place to make me comfortable me not to entertain yourself mr bar keep  i left after one beer even with cleavage from that hottie in my face  i could not take this unprofessional jerk
a friend and i went in for a nice lunch after walking around and not finding anything much better we immediately liked the ambiance  as it had a scottishpub like feel to it  almost we sat down  excited to see what the food would be like  i ordered a chicken sandwich  and my friend got a roast beef sandwich my sandwich was literally two pieces of slightly buttered bread with some slightly undercooked pieces of grilled chicken breast stuck in between it i ordered lettuce and tomatoes with it  and it came on the side with only enough for one pieces of the sandwich i shrugged that off and ate it  just because it was pretty cheap and i didnt want to be too picky  then we saw our waitress drinking a glass of wine at the register  we didnt say anything at the time  so as not to be troublesome and whiny  but i did call them a few minutes later and asked to speak with the manager i told him about the situation i tried to be very nice and his response was  yup we were just tasting a house wine k  like it was my fault one of his staff members were drinking  and it was not just a sample  i dont have a problem with drinking obviously  but doing it on premises  and right in front of the customersi mean  sheeshshe couldve at least made it into the kitchen  needless to say  im def not going back there
brought some out of town guests here for some fresh new england seafood and ended up having a down right nasty experience  the prices are ok and the seafood was tasty if standard  my fried seafood plate was surprisingly large  fresh  and varied  but here are the negativesand i mean the ruinyourmeal kind of negatives  as a table of 9 they sat us in the long booth in the back by the kitchen  throughout the meal there were fruit flies everywhere  not a plague  but certainly enough to be unpleasant and in your drink  but the green wormy bug that one of us found coming out of a fried scallop was enough to ensure that wed never return  oh  and they charge for soda refills
one word this place isnt so good  after a night out at noir  see previous review  we decided to come here instead of getting shawarma unfortunately  it was 2 am so all the drunkards came in from the other local establishments it was really loud and people were obnoxious and honestly it made me really uncomfortable and irritable  the food is also standard ihop quality many calories  really heavy  really filling  and not very good two of us ordered their chicken and waffles and it was likened to something worse than something from a tv dinner   anyways  this started a search for reasonable chicken and waffles in boston  hopefully we find some  edit we tried coming back here at 330 am one night since nothing else was open  but they refused to serve us even though they close at 4 am because they were washing the carpets an unfortunate ending to an unfortunate decision to attempt to eat at this unfortunate establishment
this gotta be one of the worse and unhealthy places in the whole world  our server was smoking right in front of our table with the entire staff and completely ignored us every time we need it something hows the 020 tip now we will never go back  stay away 
the worse service and cold food i had in a long time management  a dish washer can do a better job  never again not even for free 
i am giving it a star because of the fact i am amazed it is still in business  honestly it is not barbeque  it is food that sits under a heat lamp and tastes like it belongs in an high school cafeteria  it is the only bbq place in the area  but i highly recommend you look yonder if a bbq craving hits
lousy menuboard italian food place fifty steps behind basta pasta and maybe a half step above the gold standard for bostonarea italian culinary failure mikes in davis square  the first thing you might notice  after you squeeze by a person or two to get to your table  is the nice failing suburban pizza place motif  then you get your menu and see prices at or a little higher than olive garden or basta pasta  setting your hopes appropriately until the first morsel hits the table    in our case that first glimpse was salad  a spread of lettuce with some notallthewayslicedthrough white onions  tomatoes  and huge chunks of cucumber  on the side a little plastic cup of red oil they call raspberry vinaigrette  garlic bread  a lot of it  not so garlicky    we both did the make your own spaghetti with various vegetables  tomato sauce  and i got sausage  the vegetables were just thrown in thoughlessly my onions were giant rings placed under the spaghetti and the sauce was typical lowquality watery peppery crap  boooooooo  locationreliance
the subtitle for this restaurant should be  home of the burrito of infinite regret  both my girlfriend and i were sick after eating at this spot the burrito was large  but the meat was dry and the guac tasted terrible  all in all  we would never  ever go back funnily enough  we also noticed that it was named ris best mexican grill we have decided not to return to ri for any period of time weak
i was drawn to university market for the subway i no longer go to university market because of the subway  ive never had a worse sandwich created than by the staff here you get the feeling that they really  really hate you for being a customer the bread is always underproofed and limp  and the sandwich artists rarely listen to what you want  and when they do  seem incapable of remembering more than 1 ingredient you ask for at a time  if you order a sandwich from this subway  be sure to watch like a hawk  because youll end up with jalapenos  dijon mustard  and nothing else on your tuna sandwich if you dont topper you have to ask to get your sandwich cut in half come on  as for the market  its not bad  with a decent selection of goods  beer  etc they now have a 5 minimum purchase for a credit card   avoid and save your love of sandwiches
bens roomate posting  beautiful atmosphere  perfect music  2am license in cambridge  lovely hotel horrible service  went to noir tonight with my girlfriend for the first hour of my birthday  sat down in a romantically lit leather corner  we approach the bar as the only server around doesnt seem interested in our business  though she serves the table next to us for our first round  a scarlet street champagne signature cocktail and a house sidecar  scarlet came out fine  but my the bartender dumped 2oz of champagne into my drink to compensate for the 2oz pour  next round belle de brillet on the rocks and a naughty opear  the bartender delivers the signature cocktail whose second ingredient is supposedly belle de brillet and informs me that they cant pour my rocks drink because theyre out of belle de brillet  with the cool atmosphere and ambiance  if noir could get its cocktails and service down  they could be the coolest spot in cambridge  until then
tommy doyles has such a great ambiance  the lights were dim  the style of the room was great  unfortunately  the food made me want to leave immediately stay away from any of the burgers  however the beer was great  it dulled the pain of dealing with the service  my waitress was so rude  she had shifty eyes  they were really shifty  the only reason a person should visit tommy doyles is to grab a nice little restraunt horror story
not sure whats worse  the bands  the bouncers  the food or the customers   i would skip this nightmare unless you are in the 1822 age group
weak
oh my god this place serves awfully bad food and provide equally awful service  the sirloin steakhad lots of fat attached to it and it was dry the plate was so small that the food was falling out of it not because there was too much food  but because there was a ridiculously small plate  the outdoor seating was the only nice thing about it even their warm drink by the time they get to you is very cold  i will never go there again  and they have two bathrooms  but they are either  or and both are extremely gross why the hell would they do that i dont get it
my first time there today for lunch  im sorry i even bothered  while the atmosphere is great  the food is terrible  i ordered the black bean soup it was grey  yes grey  it was watered down with vinegar so the sour cream curdled in it  the cuban sandwich looked as if it was taken from a box of frozen sandwiches and the ham was spoiled  needless to say i walked out  dont bother going there if you want to eat
rachel ray are you on crack  well i swear i saw rachel ray from the show 40 a day go to this place and rave how the food was delicious and great price first off i find her show to be really annoying and the only reason i was watching was because she was doing boston   so on a nice day a friend and i decided to grab lunch on the outside area located with a view of that lil park area well we decided on burgers and gooosh were they pitiful the meat was very low quality over cooked and down right nasty the only way we could force down some of it was by literally covering it in ketchup also no french fries just some plain chips despite being the best thing on my plate i assumed for the price they could hit me up with some fries  my suggestions are go to basically any other place in the area and you will be happieron our way out i did see one guy who seemed to know how to order in this place and that was just a beer and a plate of chips   man this place is such a waste of space and rachel ray needs to lay off the crack
hmmmm wat can i say it was an experience   well i randomly ended up here one night  i didnt eat but the food seemed just like any other chinese take out place  i swear they use a standard menu which all takeout places must conform to   but i did go to the bar area and shared a scorpion bowl with friends  i thought those things were supposed to be strong any hoot we finished the bowl and opted for some straight alcohol instead which was being served out of what seemed like a closet upstairsalil sketchy  after being fully liquefied a few of my friends decided to come join us his first response over the phone was what the heck ok we will call when we arrive  once he arrived his response was hey were the only asians in hong kong  which i found rather humorous but could have been the fact that the closet was making some decent drinks   basically i havent been back  dont really plan on going back  and i defiantly learned its not always about where you are but the people you with that makes the night fun
the food and drinks are not worth it  all they had for white wine was a blah blend  i got the shrimp skewer with pineapple salsa and it was horrible  the shrimps were really little only came with three and the salsa was nonexistent literally  i had a hard time finding it on the plate  the weird thing was  it was served on a tortillaso after i ate the shrimp  i had this tortilla to eati felt a little awkward just eating a plane tortilla but since this is what i ordered for dinner i had to eat it  safe to say i will never eat here again
disappointing flavor aside there are no excuses for bad cooking our chicken drumstick appetizer was undercooked the rice that came with my entree tasted stale and my salmon was definitely not fresh we didnt have dessert the atmosphere was nice though
ive been to mayfield both for lunch and dinner  both times i walked away feeling underwhelmed    first  the prices are high for what you get  with the abundance of competition in palo alto  including a fabulous restaurant right next door  its hard to understand why mayfield does not offer more competitive pricing  secondly  the food is just not very tasty  i recall the pancetta pizza in particular  it tasted really bad  third  service is lacking  waiter did not check up on us and we had to flag down someone to clear our plates and bring us dessert menus  after dessert menus were given to us  no one came back to take our order for another 20 minutes  at that point we really just wanted to leave  lastly  towards the end of the night they offer complimentary bread to their patrons  not sure if this is the way they go about getting rid of their breads  i thought this was a very nice surprise  but found the bread to be super hard right when i got home  i mean  seriously  no oven or microwave could have made this bread any softer  all in all  mayfield was a disappointment both times  i would not recommend this restaurant at all
i remember this place being a lot better than it was last weekdid they change ownership at the guadalupe location
i dont understand all the hype about this placethe watered down and extremely sweet bubble tea to the sauces that seemed like marinades for overcooked veggies and a bowl of bland and overcooked brown rice the servers seemed like robots without emotions and smiles and i almost got sick from eating here the 50 items on the menu are enough confusion to begin with the spicy is a mild at the very best wont go back
even though im not a fan of the hookahs  i do enjoy stopping by kasbah now and again their chai is delicious and the music is great the only downsides are that ive never been able to sit inside but the cushions do look comfortable  and that the huge chain video store across the street kind of ruins the view  edited nov 2007  i found out the other day i havent stopped by in a while that this place now makes getting a hookah mandatory as someone who a doesnt smoke and b doesnt always go with friends who smoke  this seems pretty stupid im not paying 14 for a hookah so i can hang out and enjoy the chai  thank you very much my rating just plummeted
i sentence damon  pythias to yelp jail let me state my case  i went to lunch this week with the hubs and we ordered the simplest foods in america a tuna salad  sandwich and a hamburger my honeys hamburger had iceberg lettuce which wasnt a deal breaker but  based on preference  i think its as tacky as wearing plaids and stripes lettuce snobs  stand up  their serious offense putting fennel seeds in my tuna sandwich why would anyone do this is this common how long has this been going on give me green apple  cranberries  relish  anything but fennel seeds i hate fennel seeds in grumpy smurf voice   please remand damon  pythias to the custody of yelp jail what im a law  order fan 
why did i decide to try this place again  still not goodi think this was definitely my last visit everbut they are still very nice
if youre living off meal points and youre in need to waste them  this is might be your dining location of choice at berkeley if not  then i would advise you to save your money and stop at walgreens or one of the restaurants in sproul plaza there will always better a cheaper and tastier option than the golden bear cafe  the sandwiches are probably the best deal here  theyre toasted and include a relatively generous helping of deli meat other than that  the salads are not bad although it depends who is actually making them behind the counter with that said  you can get much better for cheaper about two blocks away  be it at sufficient grounds sandwiches or cafe mattina salads and sandwiches  the place is generally packed with freshmen and sophomores in between 11 am and 2 pm  meaning that you have to wait in line for about 15 minutes to get your food  10 minutes to pay for it and 5 minutes to find a seat outside provided  of course  that you dont want to sit next to a homeless man
i went here for a happy hour during a weekday    the only things i can remember out of this experience were cons too loud  i could not even hear the person across from me pretty expensive since tapas only come with a few piecesand you need a few orders to get you full parking sucks but that goes for most rice village restaurantsstoresbars  the foodnothing special for me to remember    i left with the thought that i dont plan to really come back
not very knowledgeable staff  slow service  food is edible if you dont care what it tastes like  tho convenient location but i would go elsewhere there are a few better japanese restaurants few doors down   i have noticed a trend here  most people who give really good reviews about sadako seem like those who dont know betterno offense  but how much should i trust those reviews from the people who appear to be a bunch of college kids i asked myself  so i gave it a try  their spicy tuna is horrible  despite the fact that too many reviews give them two thumbs up  still  it is horrible  what i taste in their spicy tuna seemed to be a mixture of vietnamese chili sauce sambal and maybe sriracha sauce if they even knew that it is the sauce originally from a region called sriracha in thailand the spice that they put in there masks all the tuna taste that i couldnt even taste tuna   that may be why so many people like it  they cant even taste the fish  tonkatsu is way greasy and the pork was over cooked it was tough and chewy the tonkatsu sauce is obviously one of those cheaper brands with a strong vinegar taste and when i asked for ponzu sauce  the waitress didnt even know what it was how they pick their employee is very questionable   in short  if you look for easy overpriced nonauthentic very americanized food they call fake japanese  go there you wont be disappointed  but if you pride yourself to be anything else more than that  dont ever go there i made this mistake twice  but there will be no third time
no thai serves no thai food  this is exactly how i feel about their food  pad thai is hard to make good  but it is not that easy to screw up they way they do it at no thai yes  i find it funny that  makes much more sense in this sentence  i love thai food and i can take quite spicy and i know thai food well enough to the point that i can say that  the food here is horrible  i am openminded so i gave them a try for a few things  the few main things that it is a shame if they screw up while claiming to serve thai food  i had pad thai  what did i get some chinesestir fry noodle with nothing  zero things that resemble padthai  or even the most americanized version of it i have had in my life  if they call it rice noodle chowmen  it would be much more forgivable because thats what it really is but when you are lured to go there by their claim of thai food  you will feel like these are a big marketing illusion that makes you want to kick yourself afterward  i order two curries by different names i have cooked with thai food with the real thai ingredients enough to tell that these are made from exactly the same curry base with slightly different amount of water added and different vegetablesunnecessary additives and this is not the way thai curries work i took one bite of each and could not force myself to enjoy it even though i had paid for it  their thai basil stirfry is the worst news of all im not sure if they even bother using the dried real thai basil to me  it tasted like dried italian basil and they can only fool those people who have not had the real deal of thai food   so for a 78 bucks worth of noodle  go to some chinese restaurant would be my better recommendation you should either 1 get much more food or 2 cheaper food 3 both
sorry le dog  i made a mistake by thinking you were a hot dog place i mean  your name is le dog i realize after reading all these reviews i should have ordered soup so for now  i will have to give you 1 star  and when i return and have the soups  i will reconsider   anyway  about the hot dogs  the buns were straight from a bag  low quality  not toasted at all the meat itself was like straight from a supermarket as well very poor quality people who have been to berkeley know the high quality hotdog place called top dog  i was hoping for something like this  but was very dissapointed i think if the hot dogs themselves are so poor  they should just rename the shop le soup and stop serving hotdogs altogether i am very curious to go back and have some soup though  in summary  my bad for not ordering soup  but le dogs bad for selling hotdogs and naming themself le dog
ive had a few sandwiches here  subs were ok hard to mess up but the falafels are way worse than the ones at the food trucks  interesting that every positive review about this place has been filtered by yelps secret algorithm  presumably because they look an awful lot like they were written by the owners trying to salvage their rating  that just about sums up kendall market
been here several times for drinks worth going for the monday night 10 cent wings and some beers avoid all other times  ate an actual meal here yesterday for lunch and food was below average boyfriend ordered the pastrami  and i ordered the crab cake sandwich that came with a side of cole slaw and french fries asked if i could substitute the cole slaw for another vegetable side  but was rejected thats fine   things got weird after i got my food crab cake sandwich had half a dollop of the aioli sauce that was mentioned in the menu it was tasteless i asked for some sauce  aioli  tarter  really just anything to make it taste like something waiter rolled her eyes and said the management was stingy and told me nounless i want to pay an extra 50 cents for it yes  50 cents isnt much  but after showing her the lack of sauce in my sandwich  she wouldnt budge whatever  super annoying then 10 minutes after we were eating  the waiter comes over  mumbles something incoherent  and takes away my halfeaten coleslaw wtf i was so confused  annoyed and just hungry    summary  1 management is stingy as witnessed and quoted by the server 2 paying 30 for two mediocrebelow average sandwiches and cold fries sucks 3 hold on to your food or it might get randomly taken away by the server
very disappointing i just got back from lunch at za and the pizzas are pretty bad to say the least the dough bears no resemblance to any kind of vaguely decent pizza dough it has no chewiness  bad flavor  tastes like someone made a sad bread dough and stretched it thin in a somewhat deep pizza dish the sauce and cheese tasted straight out of your grocers freezer seriously  there are much better frozen pizzas than this   the avocado salad on the other hand was tasty avocado was ripe and the dressing was nice  not sure cheese was necessary since cold shredded cheese like that doesnt tend to add a ton in the way of flavor but overall good   on to dessert unbelievably bad my friend tried their goat cheese chocolate cheesecake she is not sure she likes goat cheese so she asked the server how strong it was he said it tasted like regular cheesecake and then quickly added a i love it  its my favorite it was almost indescribably badtasted like pure goat cheese so strong it was probably off mixed with some bittersweet cocoa powder if there was sugar there we didnt really notice it she returned it the server was very nice and apologized but we still had to pay for it and  after returning the cake we notice a couple more being returned to the kitchen so it wasnt just us   i definitely plan not to eat here any time soon but one thing i would consider is coming for a beer after work the bar looks nice and  im hoping  they cant really screw up beer
typical harvard sqall style  no substance  i know its a bar at night  but they have a big we serve breakfast sign out front  worst breakfast  ever burnt shirred eggs with burnt potatoes on the side i mean completely burnt  not over browned  but charcoal burnt  honestly  how can you fuck up breakfast just fry some eggs  add bacon and butter some toast and im happy  harvard sq restaurants have reached a new low now im nostalgic for the old green house cafe  which wasnt even that good
overpriced and thoughtless  bland food  i could not even finish my lobster risotto  which is pathetic  if you are cooking with lobster meat which only needs butter to taste good there really is  no excuse to mess up   like someone else here i would have loved to send it back but i genuinely doubted they would come back with anything better    one gets the feeling the only way this place has customers is because of the location  put this restaurant anywhere other than harvard square and it would be empty  for the same price you are much much better off at any of the high end restaurants in central sq
ugh this food is gross but im biased since im from los angeles  where food is good injera was white  food did not have a touch of spice or flavor  and its way too overpriced for what it is this place totally waters down ethiopian cuisine to make it suitable for ann arborites definitely do not go here if youre used to real ethiopian
i love the waffle house  really i do i take my 4 year old out for a waffle and he loves it i had never taken him to this particular wh  and boy was it special heres the list of firsts 1 waitress takes a phone call in the middle of taking our order tells me to hold up 2 when my boy asks about the tattoo on her arm  she grants him the knowledge that once you get a tattoo  youre gonna wind up back in jail once the police know to look for that tattoo youre gonna wind up back in jail 3 the waitress takes another phone call and walks out the back door to take it proceeds to lock herself out  and a customer must let her in  overall  not one of my best wh experiences
im not sure why people go here for cupcakes  karas cupcakes in town  country is soooo much better  first of all  they dont tell you this  but they charge you tax when you say you are eating here  versus if you take it to go  i tried their most popular cupcake red velvet  it was acceptable  chocolate cake was moist and good flavor  but frosting is way too sweet  i also tried the milk chocolate  and this was unbelievably bad  we only took two bites and had to throw it away  it tastes like something you get from safeway  frosting is sweet and synthetic  and the cake was one of the most disgusting chocolate cake i had  tastes like synthetic chocolate dry muffin  maybe it was a bad batch or something  their cupcakes look cute but not tasty  i will never waste another 350 on any of their cupcakes  highly recommend karas cupcakes if you havent try
i always meant to eat here  and see what kind of restaurant filled shalimars old space but i wont  now as i was strolling down the ave a few weeks ago one of the employees saw me and made nasty kissy faces through the window  and then he ran out to the back door to stand in the doorway  leer  and wolf whistle hella nasty  discourteous  and unprofessional  i will not be giving gran sabor my money i miss pepes really badly  but ill make do with chipotle the ave can be skeezy enough without businesses upping the street harassment if i could give them negative stars i would theres too many decent mexican restaurants to put up with outofline behavior like that i just feel sorry for the owners
it was a nasty summer day in boston  middle of july  90 degrees  mercilessly bright  air so thick you could cut it with a knife perfect day to stay inside  eat ice chips  watch reruns  and enjoy the ac where was i smack in the middle of the heat  on the streets  slowly dying as my friends dragged me to hsin hsin for lunch the only thing keeping me going was the thought of cool  recycled air at the end of the journey  but there was no cool air to be had the ac was turned off why whyyyy meanwhile  the sweaty bodies of the dozens of loud  overexcited undergrad diners filled the stale  muggy air with the smell of hormonepacked bo seconds after sitting down at our booth  i could feel moisture gathering under my legs it was so damn hot hoping to avoid leaving an embarrassing wet mark on the back of my dress  i stuck a few cheapass  thinass napkins under my thighs  only to have them almost immediately dissolve and stick in unattractive clumps to the backs of my legs was this hell  at least the food was worth the trip  right nope my sweet  sour pork was dry and tasted like the meat had gone bad the lobster soup was thick  and brown  and gloopy the fried rice was decent  but can anyone really screw up fried rice the best things on my plate were the crab rangoons  but in that kind of heat  fried foods sit in the stomach about as well as balls of lead yummy  whats utterly baffling to me is how the bf and his buddies can continue to consistently eat here late night study breaks hsin hsins brunch line at pour house too long hsin hsins craving shitty really shitty food hsin hsins the only explanation for this is the late delivery hours and relatively cheap prices  huge portions still  who would want giant servings of rancid sludge  right  ive known all along that the bf has poor taste in chinese food  but this has got to stop its time for desperate measures  every time he orders from hsin hsins  im going to make him get a manzilian im pretty sure thats a fair trade off
this restaurant is one of the reasons that i dislike chains  burgers are greasy not juicy greasy  decent salad bar  not dazzling decent  will not be back
oh dear me i drafted a review on my phone  then i read other user reviews on here  ann arbor  wtf how can people actually think this place is worth the   it doesnt have atmosphere  authenticity or good food  i know  i lived in japan for 7 months it isnt good sushi by japanese standards  neveryoumind completely lacking the amazing creativity american restaurant owners put into it and its more expensive than eating at the fing lark      here is my suggestion  before anyone else decide something must be authentic due to its run down interior  shitty food  absurd menu  terrible prices and rate it as a 4 star restaurant dont just dont do it  then i wont have to go there and see if you are right and piss myself off      here is my initial review  something has changed here the menu is smaller and more expensive since i was here last and the food isnt as good  in fact its mediocre and the sushi menu isnt creative at all   i ordered a softshell crab app  from a picture and it came out as a single crab  fried thats it thats all there was perfect well it was also 20   there are other 20 appetizers here as well 6 fried oysters 20 among them   total order 1 gyoza 1 softshell crab 1 salmon sashimi rice  paper  salmon no sesame no vegetable 1 spicy california roll globs of spicy mayo on a shit california roll 2 tempura shrimp roll shrimp tempura  cucumber  rice  paper  bill total 75 with tip  i dont mind dropping 75 on dinner for two at a nice place  but this isnt anywhere near that kind of place
if you enjoy a little spice in your life  dont go here  all of the food tasted so bland comparable to what i would imagine pureed toilet papers flavor to be that i had to stop eating my meal even though my stomach was still growling  there was absolutely no taste in anything on my plate  and i felt as though i was eating merely for survival purposes surely wasnt eating for enjoyment  about ten minutes after my order came  the waiter brought my check and asked if i wanted a boxwhile i was still trying to consume the tasteless mess banditos called a burrito  never have i been rushed out of a restaurant like this  the most shocking part was that nobody else came in to the restaurant the entire time we were there  and the table that was already eating when we arrived was rushed out shortly after we showed up by the wait staff  weird  strange  blah  dont waste your money
oh yam yamits not you  its meno  it really is you i care for you but i think were headed in different directions in our lives im striving for excellence and well  youre not in summation i used to love yamatos because the sushi was fresh  the prices were great but when i went back this weekend  im sorry to say  but my feelings have changed first of all  our waiter sucked dirty sweaty rancid balls he was slow to take our orders and when it came out  it was the wrong items which happens  yes but not when my friend orders two orders of hamachi nigiri and he corrects the pronounciation to nagori nagori like what are you doing in a sushi restaurant  bro there were four people in our party he took one persons order of teriyaki chicken then leaves to go put that order in  then comes back 10 minutes later to take the rest of the orders the order of teriyaki chicken came out 20 mins before the rest of the partys food comes out so we all sat there waiting until everyones food came out and so my friend ended up eating cold chicken gross then i asked for a side of ponzu and extra ginger because i cant even start my meal without it i refuse that took me asking a busboy and another 15 minutes later for it to come out i mean seriously my tempura was cold my pink roll was warm needless to say  i wont be coming back there are too many mediocre sushi places in la with good service  why would i go to one with bad  scratch that  horrible service
sucks ate here for the first time despite colleagues warnings they were right have a severe headache from the msg food was salty  rice was old and the temp of the food suggested that it had just been sitting there horrible
never again i am so sad to be writing this review as i had a pleasant experience here just days ago  but today has just put gypsy cafe on my never visit again list  my coworkers and i come to gypsy cafe today for a quick lunch and by all appearances it should have been as there were only 3 tables occupied inside when we arrived   we were met by our very rude waitress melody wish her attitude matched her name who seated us promptly with almost an air of disgust  we order our food  three sandwiches and a cheese pizza nothing complicated and waited approximately 3045 minutes for our food to arrive and saw others who had arrived after us be served promptly   when our food finally did arrive  there was no apology for the wait only our plates dropped down in front of us not once were we checked on for refills or anything the check comes and theres a dandy guest comment card we filled it out and proceeded to try to give it to the owner who was occupied on the phone but could have glanced my way to take the card but instead chose to ignore the customer that was a few feet away   wish i could give this place zero stars the food is good but not good enough to deal with that kind of service
horrible came here 30 minutes ago for a lunch birthday celebration with my work crew we were seated in a beautiful private room we had great expectations as we had heard great things about the restaurant i ordered the flat iron steak sandwich  which was open faced  small and drenched in some thick  texturally questionable horseradish sauce it was just okay  nothing special for 15 my coworker ordered the roasted tuna sandwich  when her food arrived it was a tuna salad sandwich she spoke with the waiter and explained that the description of the dish was drastically different from what was delivered she returned her dish and asked for the ahi tuna salad when her food arrived  there was a big  long  nasty hair smack dab in the middle of her salad it was visible to others sitting next to her gross the waiter just took the plate away and 15 minutes later returned with another salad the manager didnt present at all during this time frame of disgust  shock and horror when the waiter brought the 2nd attempt  he then asked if my coworker would like to speak to the manager   when the manager arrived  he says we only have males in the kitchen  so i dont understand how this could happen what does that have to do with the fact that it did happen he kept saying this over and over as to imply that my coworker put the hair in her own salad he finally apologized and seemed irritated and asked what he could do for her they ended up not charging her for her meal   never again  overpriced  rude staff and you may get an extra surprise in your meal
worst service of my life never left a place so upset yelpers  beware  let me start off with saying that i have been here twice first time the service was slow  but we got our drinks mardarin cosmos which were decent and left moderately satisfied   the next time my friends came up and wanted to catch up  grab a bite  and have a couple of drinks after a long day of work i decided to give this place a shot thinking maybe wed get better service this time around and i wanted to bring my friends here because i really liked the ambiance of this place chic  dimly lit  good beats  more of an upscale lounge compared to the dives in westwood   my friends and i arrived around 1130ish and waited for 35 minutes for the hostess to approach us only for her to tell us to sit wherever for a wednesday night  there were was decent crowd but not super crowded  we were seated and given a menu happy hour portion of the menu is kind of confusing they only have a small hh drink selection at the bottom of the menu anyway  the four of us were planning on each ordering a few drinks and a bunch of appetizers and a pizza    we waited for a server to come by for 30 minutes not a single person stopped by our table since we received our menu the hostess was running around waiting on others  but didnt even look at us we saw other waiters chatting it up at the bar and assisting a few particular tables but no one came by our table we called the hostess over and asked if she could have some take our order she said shell let our waiter know we waited another 10 minutes no one came by my friends and i were so upset we got up and left  and before we even got out the door a waitress came up to the table and cleaned up the table and cleared the menus    are you kidding me she couldnt come over to take our order but she could come as soon as we got up to clear the table what kind of service is that   after we left the place  my friends were livid and they wanted to call the place and complain about how ridiculous service was my boyfriend called and asked for the manager that night he complained about our service and explain how we got up and left because no one helped us for 40 minutes instead of sincerely apologizing this female manager had the nerve to make excuses saying that there was confusion about who was going to be our waiter really confusion for 40 minutes she also said she saw us leave and i think she was the one who came to clear up the table the phone call ended with insincere apology and nothing fixed  the management and servers here really need to pick it up if they want to survive in westwood where business get shut down left and right    i really wish i had better service because i wanted to like this place and have it be a regular hangout spot for my friends and i what a shame what a shame
service slow  atmosphere amis has a dark  chic decor in the inside  but thats really the only nice thing about the place the sushi is not fresh  food the main criterion for a sushi joint for me is the quality of the fish and the freshness of it  i had a spicy tuna roll here once and they didnt cleancut the fish correctly and so it had a real fishy taste my friends and i have gone a couple of times and not once have i been impressed with any of their rolls or sushi food is below average one time we ordered a bunch of spicy rolls with jalapenos and peppers we got food poisoning the next day such a bad experience theres another mediocre sushi joints in westwood that you can go to instead of amis
note my friend insisted on eating here since it was her birthday i had already decided to not come here by choice ever again and yet  heres my update  service this past time was terrible we waited during a nonpeak time for 1520 minutes to get our drinks in  another 510 after that to order food drinks took about 2025 minutes to come out  and food was about 40 minutes wtf seriously how hard is it to blend a fricken margarita take some of your shitty cuervo  toss in the lime  throw on too much salt  add not enough cointreau and too much ice hit blend  this time im serious im not coming here again even if it is someones birthday sorry  but ill meet up with you for the afterparty instead if i update this again  i give you all permission to slap me
what is wrong with your sandwhich makers could they be any slower everytime i stand in line to order a sandwhich  i end up regretting it if you want the sandwhich toasted  they stand there watching it warm up until it is ready instead of starting the next customers order so inefficient
totally uninspired food  once i ordered the pasta entree and it was halffrozen   i had to heat it up in the microwave  the tomato sauce was the same kind of sauce that comes with fried mozzarella sticks   the bread tastes like greasy donutsand not in a good way another time i got the vegetarian soup option and horror there was meat in it  maybe they gave me the wrong soup  i didnt go back to find out   the salads seem okay  and someone related to this restaurant makes a decent cupcake that can be found in the refrigerated case  but other than that i dont think i would ever touch anything from there ever again   its depressing to go to a restaurant that has no inspiration or passion  a place that is serving formulaic food just to make money  you can tell from the employees  too nice as they are that they have no connection to this food  i cant imagine how or why it came to be that there are so many of these places in the boston area you might as well buy a shrinkwrapped sandwich from a gas station market instead of eating here   at least you know what youre getting
baaaaa d  i guess im just over the crowded college scene  no room to move away from the bar once you get your drinks  no easy way to go pee drunk dudes looking you up and down like they want to fight i havent ever been here before  so i dont know what its like on a slow night  but i know i was getting frustrated being there   it definitely is for a certain type of person just not me
my friends and i stopped here before class one morning a couple of months ago  i love me a good breakfast  whether its just some nice fluffy scrambled eggs  or a whopping chicken fried steak covered in gravy with such high acclaim voted best breakfast in slo and slo county numerous times  or so it says i thought it was going to be a great breakfast joint i must say  i was highly disappointed with the breakfast i received  i ordered the corned beef hash  and it was just awful  canned canned corned beef hash that was hardly even heated  it flat out sucked  who serves canned food at a diner why even serve it if youre gonna serve canned stuff  on top of that  the toast was mediocre  nothing i couldnt get from a grocery store and a toaster  and my scrambled eggs were flat and somewhat rubbery  something i could achieve when i was making eggs as a 10 year old  the atmosphere is dinerlike  nothing too special going on  relatively clean  but its pretty old  to sum it up  i essentially hate this place  though i must say i hate it more because of how popular it is to everyone else  i wont ever come back here for breakfast  not worth my time  money  or abuse to my mouth and stomach  ps i had a tritip sandwich from their booth at the farmers market sucked meat was bland  bread wasnt good  barbecue sauce tasted like it came straight out of a bottle of kraft barbecue sauce and personally  i think thats one of the worst bottled barbecue sauces  disgusting  do yourself a favor and get a tritip from the firestone grill
horrible service when trying to buy a sandwich obviously this review is tainted by the fact that one person gave me a headache   grilled foccciasp sandwich  sorry machine is broken  is a cold 3 day old sandwich ok black forest ham  sorry no more black forest extra meat  sorry we have to charge you for the meat separetly before we put it in your sandwich  i think this lady was just being lazylast time i think about having lunch here
the worseeeewent with my son  wich was turning 2 and the ownermanager came and gave me this shitty excuse of why i couldnt get fried rice he said i had to be sitting on the habachi grill  versus sitting outside gtfoh serious then he continued to to tell me  that he would not even serve his son rice  if he wanted it and wasnt sitting on the hibachi grill failofyear shut it dowwwwwn
what a waste of money  unless maybe youre wasted  i had high hopes considering the novelty of rooftop dining in pittsburgh for the price point  the food and service should be a lot better  the hostesses were rude  refused to sit us in the booth and then immediately sat a couple in a booth right after us  server was sweet  but painfully slow and never refilled our water the cocktails were no where what was described about 1012 bucks a pop and zero buzz  a couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours  and when we did it was very disappointing  the guacamole was just mashed avocados  no seasoning whatsoever  the rice was clearly a mix like zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained  really gross  the shrimp in the tacos were well cooked  but it was all downhill from there  no flavor  overcooked veggies and to top off two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco  having no flavor is the worst crime against mexican food being slow and rude  the worst crime against service  really terrible place
all aspects of this place are against pizza common sense they dont serve slices fresh from the oven  they purposely cool them down and reheat when ordered  their excuse is that the pizza is too flimsy id rather have flimsy fresh pizza than reheated leftovers anyday  their crust is as with all newengland type of crust flimsy flaky with no fight or stretch  perfect for denture wearers    so why would anyone want leftover pizza with a saltinecracker crust  goto picco or posto for real fresh pizza  though denture wearers beware
as a born and bred bostonian  i grew up loving dunkin donuts  or dunkies as we used to say growing up  my favorite beverage was the iced coffee  which i still like  but  on a recent visit to dunkins after a hiatus  i noticed they still use styrofoam cups for their medium and large sized beverages  in this day and age  thats just unacceptable  one might argue that the use of styrofoam cups allows dunkins to keep prices low  but if you actually compare prices for their espresso drinks lattes  cappucinos  etc they are fairly comparable to prices at other coffee shops such as peetswhich dont use styrofoam and  in fact  have better espresso beverages  my other complaint is that there is little consistency from one dunkins to the nexti used to go to one near my work where they make the iced coffees exactly right  but at the other ones the iced coffee would be too dark or have too much sugar   there was a time when coffee shops werent all the rage and dunkins had little competition  but they have not been able to keep up sorry dunkies  but unless there are no other coffee shops within a 10 mile radius  i wont be back
this place is horrific  terrible service and thirdrate food  the only thing that makes the atmosphere fun is the liveliness of the college students there  my waitress was rude and in a bad mood  maybe she is sick of serving brainiac mit students  or maybe she wasnt help as a baby  either way  im not responsible  its a miracle of i ever come back
this place is on my way to work i love to change it up and go to various places for coffee on my way into work  so i thought id stop by sebastians for a quick cappuccino one morning big mistake the cappuccino tasted like cleaning chemicals and was the same price as a lot of other joints in the area starbucks  abp  cosi  etc also  the chef there was looming over the cashiers and breakfastmaking staff trying to get them to move faster and it was a very awkward situation to watch him lord over them i will never get coffee or any other time of edible item here again
it should be called vegan galaxy im vegetarian and was so wanting this place to be goodbut it just was terrible the kendall burger sounded good but the onion rings were tasteless  the patty fell apart and the dressed arugula and shredded cabbage were sorry sides an order of fries cant be wrong  can it oh no  tasteless strikes again they seem to think that you can throw a dusting of an herb on top of anything and call it done it left me wondering if they had sucked the flavor out of the fries and maybe injected it into some other dish all desserts we ordered were inedible i will never ever go here again 
this review is for the restaurant some friends and i were meeting on a saturday night near the holidays and sat a big table weve done this in the past and it was fine  we all ordered drinks and appetizers to share  the waitress was nice when she took our order  the place wasnt even packed and we got our drinks and food pretty quickly    about 5 minutes after we got our food  the waitress comes over to tell us that we need to move from our table because we sat a table that was reserved for a private party there was nothing on the table to indicate this the table behind us and the tables against the wall had reserved signs on them but not our table we were pretty much in shock at being told that we had to move if you want us to move  then you should relocate us or help us find somewhere to move to dont just expect me to move because you screwed up and forgot to put a reserved sign on the table where i have been sitting for nearly an hour now i dont expect four star service at a place like this but if youre going to screw up  dont expect me to fix your mistake for you that is why you get paid we asked for a manager we never got to speak to one a little bit of attention to paying customers would be nice from the management we never had anyone come to our table and take our check we all had to walk to the bar to pay our bill  the complete lack of professionalism here is astounding  it was a nice experience until they realized they needed another table for their reservation but this experience was a deal breaker for me slo brews management and staff need to get it together because my friends and i will never return because of how rudely we were treated
this used to be a great restaurant  even for a chain then  they changed the menu and servers here and its just become a total crapshoot i hadnt been there in a long time and decided to meet a friend for lunch they had just horrible  nonexistent service not once did they refill any of our drinks  even after we asked for refills  it took forever to get our food my friends pizza was good and i enjoyed my spaghetti i would have given them 2 stars and another shot but for what i saw on my bank statement when i got home i paid with our credit card and my friend left a cash tip on the table when i looked at my credit card bill  someone at the restaurant put a tip on my card i called my credit card company to dispute the additional tip on my card and called the restaurant they apologized and said they would take it off i told them that i had already done that with my credit card company and was also going to inform the slo police department regarding the fraudulent charge to my credit card this just reinforces why everyone should check their bank statements against the receipt they are given needless to say  i will not be returning to this establishment
my family and i went there because of the excellent times we have had there in the past we have never been there for dinner before but with a choir performance to see we gave it a shot we decided to go with the fish and chips as well as chicken and chips along with  of course  clam chowder the chowder was good but was quite salty the fish and chicken were terrible i guess you dont expect much for 8 but i do expect for my food not to be swimming in grease also  we were excited about the curly fries over half of them were either under or overcooked the night shift needs quite a bit of help we were just not happy with our crappy experience
abysmal this pizza is consistently advertised as best in rhode island on wbru i would recommend that victorias pizzeria stop spending money on commercials and start spending money on producing a quality product  my friends and i had pizza there this evening  we drove from greenville  ri to get it because of its muchtalkedabout qualities the barbeque pizza was recommended  we added bacon to it  tasteless  doughy and cooked excessively on top and not at all on the bottom is what seems to be the common sentiment from the other reviewers here  i share that with them the bacon  appeared to be bacon bits  the crust was unseasoned and clearly preproduced the similarity to a lowtier frozen pizza at your local grocer is where this pie ranked  the establishment is  ostensibly  a convenient store cigarettes and lottery tickets appear to be on sale here  as well as a variety of vending gondolas for grabandgo type foods the excessive clutter  lack of focus on customer service due to the counterpersons unbelievable inability to make eye contact while speaking to me and the poor quality product earn this pizzeria a solid one  this isnt a pizzeria  its a sacrilege stay clear
i went here after reading the great reviews ive never done hookah or weed or cigarretes before and my date and i  thought it would be fun we had a fun time and around 1 am the place started to empty out we were sitting next to the drafty stairs and moved our seats   like any bar we thought that would be ok when our waitress came over we asked to make sure that it was ok and before she could answer a hostess came over literally screaming at me and told me how where i was sitting was for bigger parties ie more money and i said we were cold where we were  she then ripped the drum i was holding and playing with from me and humiliated me in front of my date while she continued to yell at me  my waitress was very sympathetic and understood when i asked for the check i confronted the hostess after and told her she didnt have to treat us like dirt and that she ruined a great night i was having she was remorselessso we decided to go to the owner to complain  her only concern was that we moved without asking again place was 60 empty by then and it was our first time does that excuse the behavior apparently  the owner made no amends  didnt apologize at all  didnt offer anything  didnt seem to care about anything other than the fact that we moved i explained again that it was our first time and we arent trouble makers she didnt care  i am under no illusions that if you like hookah and like going out to drink that you will avoid this place because of my review  but i think the true character of this place should be revealed no one should be harassed like this and management should not allow or condone it   again started out as a great fun night and  i left there literally in tears management saw me in tears and couldnt have cared less
one word   brutal
i went to this place yesterday after reading some good reviews  this place is not up to par with my indian food standards and im an indian food connoisseur  i will not go back to this placeever because of the following  1 dirty plates and cups  2 water tasted like warm tap water  dirty i should have brought my nalgene 3 the tea was bittersweet  even added sugar to try to alleviate the bitterness 4 naan bread seemed stale and not luxuriously fluffy  like it should be 5 dishes were spicy which is actually good because thats how indian food should be  but spice does not equal taste  the spiciness was so overwhelming that the taste was somewhere lost in transition 6 the rice came with little chunks  poor basmati rice etiquette 7 the chicken in the chicken  cauliflower dish i forgot the name  but besides the point was extremely dry  disgusting it was like the chicken was cooked separately and thrown in as an afterthought  i will never go back to this indian food place again  i was so disappointed  naan  curry is way better than this joint and a little cheaper  too  and they have clean dishescups
the hot dogs here are alright ive had the hotlink  the chicken apple  and the lemon chicken they are all super small  and very pricey all dogs are 3 bucks honestly  the hot dogs seem like things you can find at a local safeway or trader joes  nothing special about them what so ever   the place is really crowded and trashy  and the guy that works there is a complete dbag my friend was with me and he didnt know what to order  so he was looking over the selection  and my friend literally only spent like 30 seconds looking at the menu  when the guy working there  told him to order a dog or leavewhat a jackass
i couldve understood the appeal of cpk six or seven years ago  when new american cuisine and fusion were still in vogue in the culinary world  but now the popularity of this franchise is flabbergasting  theyll throw anything and everything on a pizza  and hope it works its kind of like writing a script on index cards  throwing them in the air  and determining the structure based on which ones you pick up first  i dont want carne asada on a pizza i dont want guacamole and sour cream on a pizza i dont want peanuts on a pizza i dont want potatoes on a pizza i dont want mangos on pizza  whats worse is that cpk wants you to think that  to quote samuel l jackson in pulp fiction  youre getting the gourmet shit no  youre not getting a burrito on a pizza is just a bad idea  and it should be stopped  they dont offer much else  paninis  ceasar salad  thai chicken peanut pasta  etc  etc  etc
everything about this bar sucks 45646477474378923342131 times 8 876 046  squared
when youre from san diego this is no where close to mexican food
the fried fish was aweful the fish had no spices for taste at all  the oil in which it was tried was stale the fish had this stale oil taste  the curry in the meal had weird spice taste as well wonder if its the stale oil again their chicken kabobs might be better since that seemed the standard one everyone was ordering in general  my first experience was not very satisfactory the other indianpakistani restaurants sitar  new delhi around the corner have better tasting meals for cheaper price
i have no other alternative than to shop here as i dont own a car and any other grocery store is too far away from my place than this one but i have started hating it more and more  they regularly carry very old dairy products milk  yogurt  cheeses and produce i have found rotting cheeses and other produce full of fungus growing over it in the deli section  they remove good products from their selection completely like i used to buy one particular bakerys chocolate cake cant remember the name which was made from very healthy wholesome ingredients  but they discontinued it and now replaced with that are unhealthy fatty cakes  i wish i was staying in some other area and didnt have to shop my groceries here i hate this store to the core
food poisoning woke up at 2am throwing my guts up   i really think it was the cheese it had a very strong sake base and the alcohol was very strong and overwhelming   over priced  small portions if i were ever to come back which i highly doubt  i would only come for the dessert which was good but then again  its really hard for something dripping in chocolate not to be good
it was moderatly busy a party of five  seated immediatly and ordered cocktails and water for the table waitress left and came back 10 minutes later to take food orders 5 minutes later receive cocktails  10 minutes later we remind her about the water for the table  receive it 5 minutes later about 10 minutes later one of our party orders an extra app and not more than 60 second later the fried calamari he ordered came out  so wheres our food 15 minutes later is where  the dumplings were greasy and had almost no filling  everything else was average  so heres the kicker they gave absolute crap service and then tacked on 18 tip  thankfully we were able to give 5 with the hopes that they tipped out to the bartender for the drinks
this review is solely based on the service here   i dont remember the name of the waitress who served us  but i didnt come back to find out    my sister  her boyfriend  and i came here for breakfast  the service was fine we knew that we didnt leave enough tip when she took the check  but she sounded hurried so we let her take the check and told her that we didnt need change  no more than a minute later  while we were still sitting and sorting out her tip mind you money was on the table and our wallets were still open  she came up to us and demanded to know why we didnt tip her and told us that if the service was bad  we should have let her know  she was loud enough that people around us stopped eating and looked up at us  i know this because i sat facing them  we have never been so mortified and embarrassed    if she had just walked by and listened to our conversation or just looked at our actions  she would have known that we werent about to skip without leaving her a tip  at that time we threw down some money and just left as quickly as we could  but in hindsight we should have called over the manager and let the waitress have it  this was completely unacceptable service  if the service was bad  she could have waited to talked to us as we were leaving the restaurant in a more appropriate tone and volume  its been a while since this incident and im positive she no longer works there  but as a note to management  please make sure you train your staff on how to be discreet  its common sense  but you cant assume that people have it
my friend and i were listening to music and painting  we were hungry but didnt want to go outside  i didnt know what i wanted so i left the decision up to him  he chose italian  he said he didnt know of anywhere in the area and didnt have any takeout menus and asked if i had any suggestions  i really dont eat italian food very often and i really dont know the area very well but i remembered a formerfriend favorablymentioning presidential pizza so i suggested it  and everything went downhill from there  it ended up bordering on the absolutely absurd  we looked it up on google to get the phone number  we were sent to a page of reviews  and it was preposterous how many of the reviews were glowing and hysterically phrased presidential pizza is the best pizza in the planet earth nyc has the best pizza in the planet presidential pizza is the best in nyc  and presidential pizza has the best pizza in the universe its always fresh and perfectly delicious its the best italian food i ever had i recommend penne vodka with grilled chicken the pizza is to die for  and presidential pizza is the best pizza you will ever taste just thinking about it makes my mouth watered there is something about the tomato sauce  the best in the world  and presidential pizza its by far the best pizza i ever had perfect crust  perfect cheese  perfect souse yum men is delicious  why not try it  right as julia roberts says in pretty woman big mistake huge  we got a caesar salad which was gross  the dressing was really salty and sweet  the croutons were stale and really salty  and the lettuce was slightly brown and we got a large steak pizza  the meat was tough and oily  the cheese was tough and oily  and the crust was cold and chewy and we got the fettuccine alfredo with grilled shrimp  which was extremely oily and salty  and it had congealed into a big lump  yuck  an absolutely horrible experience all around we ended up throwing out about 75 of the food rather than further torturing ourselves and one another  we really only had a couple bites each of each item and that was way more than enough
overcooked  overbooked  overpriced
finding good eats around columbia university can be a challenge  especially on broadway the options on amsterdam are better the broadway section of the neighborhood is full of places like vine  which look sleek  but offer nothing in terms of quality   vine suffers from the asian fusion disease that seems to plague manhattan nobu made asian fusion fashionable asian fusion establishments with their own version of the rock shrimp tempura in a creamy spicy sauce began to sprout all over manhattan the problem is that most of these restaurants are not run by experienced and inventive chefs capable of making wildly imaginative dishes that combine the flavors and textures of peru  japan  china and france instead  they make insipid versions of various asian dishes     the management at vine is chinese im sure they could whip up some decent chinese food but there are no chinese items on the menu the selection ranges from pad thai to sushi  passing through udon noodle soup and chicken teriyaki i had the udon noodle soup with a salad the soup was woefully lacking in flavor the salad was not fresh
panda express is panda express better than other steamtable chinese chains  not good for much of anything else  you can get it all over the place why did it have to come to the stanford student center food court and push out the previous chinese place  which at least was different and not panda express all the bloody time  and had really good saltandpepper chicken wings  ive only eaten here a couple of times  but i have to report that one lunchtime recently was the only time ive ever had really bad service at a panda express  the server taking my order was just utterly clueless and had no idea what i wanted  either when i said it or pointed to it  and mostly stood there looking dim  i gave up and walked out  had a teriyaki bowl at the treehouse instead  much better  and not the exact same thing i can get in a million other places
stopped in for a beer  sat on the patio and had an insipid porter and a bland ipa  the wafting stench from something that must have been dead and rotting on the river bank below didnt help  beer reminded me of what youd get at a brewpub run by ab or coorsmolson
the name fits  its south troy  what do you expect worst burger outside of a prison  assuming they serve burgers in prison
the food is disgusting this is the restaurant against which i judge every other awful restaurantthe brown standard id imagine the two positive reviews here are made by the owner and his friends i have no idea how this awful place stays in business
flavorless garbage   not much else to say  maybe one thing else  youre better off eating a pbj sandwich
when it comes to chinese food i am pretty easy to please but this place was horrible i could not get over how my food tasted reheated the rice also had old taste to it my friend ordered sushi and regretted it dearly as we both noticed the worker at the sushi with his finger knuckle deep in his nose and then with no gloves handle some of the sushi just plain eeeek all around
gave it another shot theres no hope for this place
their chicken taste like pork awful music along with the food
we went here a few times as college students the long wait  small and stuffy dining area and rude service could be forgiven if the food was good  it was not unless you like burned and overgreasy pad thai  skip this dump for the better thai places on the ave
i had vegi yakisoba the noodles were not throughly cooked  it all sticked together and hard to eat  i also had tofu vege stir fry thing the tofu was covered with batter but not cooked throughly as well it was sticky and moosy i am not going there anymore
the staffs are rude  food its not that bad inexpensive and okay taste the dough is extremely dry so i needed alot of water that goes along they dont have any hot sauce i havent asked for it but what they usually display is pepper sprinkle  customer care   thank you for playing music extremely loud every night although i have informed them three times regarding loud music after 10pm on weekdays and 11pm on weekends  they dont seem to control the volume of the music once i saw them playing music at 1240 am while they were closing and cleaning the place not able to communicate with customer  unprofessional it does not matter whether i talked to the cashier or cook or district manager they ignore customers opinion and go on with its company policy it really wowed me  lets see what they will say when the civic law involves in
this is my first cliche i give this place zero stars review hmmm the wife wanted a bubble tea while hanging out on the ave the place was dead  maybe 23 customers sitting there  place was a mess tables w chairs out and napkins n trash everywhere this stuff doesnt bother me what does is my wife waiting in front of the cashier for literally 1 12 mins  not a watching lord of the rings type 90 seconds  but a george constanza waiting for his conditioner to set in his hair 90 seconds a very long time to completely ignore a customer who is right in front of you the young little lady was counting change and instead of putting customers first and taking her order or even acknowledging her with any actual words while she was there  is simply rude  unacceptable but we did get a great big death glare as if we were bothering her as she went back to counting her change there was another lady working there chatting w a guy who either also works there or is the bf  hard to tell either way none of them were doing any work except for pissing off potential paying customers good for you  im sure you dont care but im sure the owner would oh well  clap clap clap good job
several years ago  madam mams might have served delicious thai food for lower prices today  this is no longer true their prices are pretty high for a small dish i ordered a tomka soup there was too much coconut milk in the dish and in a very small bowl usually a sandwich from wendys will fill me up  this failed to make a dent in my hunger   not only that  they charge 3 for a bowl of rice i came back with friends several times again and tried both their pad thai and their pad see ew pad thai was slimy  and gross but their pad see ew was decent flat noodles  with chinese broccoli their thai tea is decent   i love thai food  and  i grew up eating after having traveled to thailand this summer  and despite me trying madam mams multiple times  i can assure you this is not real thai food the majority of the menu is a bland and poor imitation of thai food  and it is overpriced to boot
sunhing bills itself as an authentic chineseviet restaurant    the chinese dishes are mediocre  the duck is dry  the sauce is lacking their viet food fare a little bit better the owners are vietchinese and im just disappointed for that amount  i expected better quality and more food    their food was just dry and not good   id go to any other restaurant
so my brother and i flew all the way to maryland to watch our youngest brother compete in a martial arts competition  armed with our parents credit card  we promised to take him out to dinner anywhere he wanted  some fivestar restaurant in washington  dc  maybe  or baltimore  instead  he picked a restaurant a few blocks from our lovely ramada limited hotel see other review    first  they had about 4 different menus  one person in our group joked that it seemed like theyd taken menus from other restaurants and simply said to themselves yea  we can probably make that  also  when we asked at the end whether they had dessert  their answer was no  crazy talk  the food itself was average cheap chinese food  we didnt try any sushi  though they also offered that never a good sign    the most entertaining part was the rude old chinese waitresses  who made fun of our attempts to order  then ignored us  while making multiple visits to the table right next to us  for the rest of the evening  when we finally got their attention to order more tea  it turned out a bit frothy  the only time our waitress came without someone getting up out of their seat and grabbing her was after wed left payment on the table and started to leave  then she was on top of me in a flash  just to make sure wed paid  it actually was a little funny  but we only laughed to keep from crying
for a place that has boba right in the name  the boba here was not very good i had the tapioca milk tea  and again  boba is in the name of the place  so why not call it that on the menu the tea itself was very sweet  which i happen to like but may not be for everyone the problem was that the boba was way too mushy  especially on the outside  and not the proper firm chewy texture throughout also  the boba was not sweet enough my friend had a strawberry kiwi smoothie and it was very watery instead of icy not worth another visit
eww i hate islands the burger i ordered was not good the food was way too salty for me would not go back go somewhere else if you want a burger
i did not like this place at all friend and i came here late night after notsoheavy drinking and each had the chicken shawarma wrap big mistake  the chicken was dry  the sauce was flavorless and runny  and it made me bloated and feeling like crap until the next afternoon so much so that chicken shawarma was a bad choice became an inside joke  ive had good shawarma before  and this place does not make it but what can you expect from a place that spells it falafal instead of an falafel on its storefront sign
first  let me start by saying i am disappointed by their nonexistent organic produce selection if you are looking for organic produce  moms down the road is your best bet secondly  their prices are higher than their competitors   now to top it off  their customer service center is horrid they are extremely rude and offer no help to the customer i went in one afternoon to break a 5 bill for quarters since my apartment complexes laundry room only runs on quarters i asked the lady at the service center to break my bill and she just stood their  distant  arms crossed and told me in a rude and nasty way no we do not do that here go stand in line they might have change then her classy self sarcasm shouts to the guy working in the express line to give me quarters i told her i am not going anywhere then she changes the policy and tells me she can only give me change if i break a 10 bill i was very angry at her attitude and lack of genuine customer service skills so i left i called the manager immediately and he apologized and was very polite i later returned and talked to a female  the manager of the customer service center and she was able to break the 5 bill for quarters no problem   fast forward a month later i encountered the same problem with a difference customer service lady i told her i was not leaving without the change i requested so i had her page the customer service manager and the manager must have alzheimers because she said she denied ever talking to me and giving me change   rude and lazy customer service employees run the other way run to any other grocery store they seem to hire people with very little education  elementary at the highest
i would not recommend this place purely based off of the interior  when we first sat down  we saw a cockroach crawling on the wall right by our table  this was definitely unappetizing  but we were willing to forget about it  the selection of food was great and we were craving all sorts of things  we were there for brunch  though  so we both ordered omelets  they were good  but it took a loooooong time to get our food    we were actually fed before another table that got there first  though  it was just one guy cooking and one guy serving when we went  you feel a little sympathetic to them  but still    not to mention that the whole time we kept seeing more of those cockroaches crawling all around our table  even though our food was good  and the prices were decent  we cannot stand the thought of bugs in our food or around our table
tragically i picked this place even though the magical and impartial coin flip directed me elsewhere  with the exception of the delicious waffle fries the food was terrible  in addition  even though there were only a few other tables service was lacking  when youre given a sodiumdipped sandwich water becomes extremely necessary sadly  water appears to be a highly valued commodity since we were unable to find our server to request more  on the plus side they seem to have nightly drink specials that dont appear unreasonable despite this  i will not be back
disclaimer the sushi menu is also offered at the terrible bar next door    we ordered some dumplings and sushi as appetizers for our meal dumplings appeared to be from a bargain bin and perhaps microwaved within the last four hours the sushi spicy salmon seemed like it was some kind of paste rather than fish ive eaten cheap sushi before  but this wins the award for the worst ive ever had congrats
i work very close to harvest coop  so its convenient to shop when i really need something but that is the only time i will shop there after several visits  i have never encountered a cashier who would even say hello after i say it they seem to have an air of veiled contempt what is the deal with this place their prices are ridiculously high  putting them on a par with wholier than thou food at least their workers are not usually rude i hate paying for snob appeal  but obviously many others dont mind  just because a store likes to project a healthy or green image does not mean they actually are that way  nor does it mean their workers are superior to the rest of us  no thanks  i will stick to star market or foodmaster
i eat a lot of burritos and i can say without hesitation that burrito max is the worst mexican i have had anywhere  ever not authentic like el pelon  not  fast and fresh like qdoba  not simple and tasty like annas taqueria there are several more satisfying options within walking distanct of maxs kenmore square location so i cant imagine any reason you would stop by

as youre walking through price center at ucsd  you probably have your mind set on eating relatively healthy will it be a nice wrap from tacone  or maybe a sandwich from zanzibar but then it hits you like a slap in the face from an ex gf  that horribly enticing panda express smell   you tell yourself that this time it will be different  this time they have changed smell how good it smells the food must be that good or better boy  have you deluded yourself  the line moves quickly and soon youre in the front lets try and be healthy you tell yourself maybe you order the mixed veggies  but that second item is always the meat orange chicken or the crispy beef   in the end  it turns out the same it always does just like every time you get back with that ex of yours and youre left feeling disgusted with yourself at least with panda the regret goes away quickly and doesnt linger like the scent of bad perfume on your bedroom sheets
i wish you could give negative stars to certain establishments let me tell you what happened to me at this subway on friday  may 8th  2009  as sara s already stated  there arent too many healthy options at the utc mall subway is my fare of choice because i usually want to stop at hot dog on a stick and fill myself up with some luscious lemonade and a couple sticks of fried cheesy goodness i get to the counter and tell the girl id like a turkey on wheat she plops down the meat on the bread and slides it down to the next guy for condiments and veggies now  if i told you id like spicy mustard  spinach  cucumbers  pickles and lots of black olives  would you say do you want onions on that and then would you like lettuce and finally tomatoes me thinks not  it took twice as long to get my sammich constructed because mr irefusetolistentoyoueventhoughtheresnolanguagebarrier thought maybe i had amnesia and forgot what i like on my turkey on wheat then miss obvious says is that a six inch no  its a 6ft sub theres a huge difference between 6 and 12 inches  why are you asking me when the sandwich is close enough to bite you in the jugular  im done with that subway ill drive down to the chevron station or over to miramar road to get a turkey on wheat at least i wont have to deal with people who would get zeroes on an iq test
i was very disappointed in the food here the pizza was probably one of the worst i have had its so sad how they can mess up pizza i mean how do you do that had them deliver 5 pizzas and will never do it again the first slice is the only one where we could taste anything  the pizza is so thin and the amount of cheese is almost non existant as soon as you open the box it gets cold and thats it now i know pizza can taste good cold but trust me you wont even like this when its hot the sauce is super garlicy and its pretty much all thats left as a taste in your mouth when youre done  so sad there are lots of other choices for pizza  i cant imagine or even want to imagine what the other food here tastes like
probably my least favorite place to dine in princeton i did have a one good experience in the large room upstairs with friends but the food has always been subpar do not order the penang curry it was watery and bland the service isnt great and the food is terrible i miss das
the food is edible but not authentic chinese from what ive been told regardless of the quality  the service is terrible the only waitresscashier is almost always rude most of the items on the menu are not available at the time  and this information is always conveyed brusquely in a toobadeatelsewhere fashion  i have eaten there four times  and given the consistency of the service  will not eat there again
i had lunch at lulus today after st pauls easter mass  only as a last resort because crepes parisiennes and eat unique were both closed for the day  i had two bad experiences at lulus before  but that was about a year ago  and i was hungry  the memories of past horrible food had faded gently in my mind  and i was feeling forgiving    big mistake  i ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl  and bob the boyfriend ordered ramen  the food came out fast enough  so no complaints there  but from the first bite  it was clear that things had gone horribly awry  the pork on top of the bowl looked and tasted like something a dog would gnaw on  tough  dry  and very salty  underneath  my noodles were completely unseasoned  just rice vermicelli with nothing else to speak of    as for the boyfriend  bobs ramen was technically ramen  i guess  since the noodles were ramen noodles  but instead of a savory beef or pork broth  his noodles were backstroking in miso  while this is weird and cheapass of them  i cant complain  since the broth was clearly described as miso on the menu  but the real problem was the miso broth itself  the amount of miso in it made my tongue curl  it was so salty it was almost inedible  when the waitress asked me if everything was ok  i told her plainly about the dry pork and the bland noodles  and she said yup  thats the way it comes  i was stunned and didnt know what to say  so i asked her to suggest something else  she recommended the singapore rice noodles    the singapore noodles came out after a short wait  and the noodle bowl mercifully disappeared  but then the new noodles were so heavily spiced that they were again almost inedible  certainly not bland this time  though  i have to wonder if they were messing with me  finally  we asked for to go boxes and high tailed it out of there  it was a depressing  bad experience  other notes the atmosphere is horrid loud music  completely crowded  and the waitstaff is aloof  almost bitchy  im aware that this review has turned into a bit of a rant  the fact is  as i mentioned earlier  ive had two bad experiences there before  ill spare you the details  i am hoping this review will serve as a reminder to myself in the future erin  it doesnt matter how hungry you are or how much people try to talk you into lulus  dont cave  hold out for rose tea or anything  reallyanything else  dont do it
ok so i tried this restaurant based on yelp reviews and unfortunately had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life  we went on a friday night  so it was busy not sure why the service was insanely slow beyond ridiculous so brutal  also  there looked like there was only one sushi chef on a busy friday night the sushi and sashimi were well below average  both not smelling or tasting freshly  also  it wasnt a cheap place all and all i was thoroughly disappointed with the ridiculously slow service as well as the sub par food yuck
mama dips has landed on my blacklist for their atrociously bad service  so many incidents over the years i cant even remember them all  rude servers  absent servers  clueless servers  ive had them all    some favorites were the time they forgot to split my check and it then took over half an hour to correct  or the time that my waitress was sobbing  throughout the visit or the time i was seated in the back dining room and had to beg for a server after 15 minutes of nothing  or the time you get the picture  it can be real hit and miss   its too bad because the food can be pretty tasty  i really like the sweet potato biscuits  fried chicken  and fried green tomatoes  a few standouts aside though  the food is average  which would be acceptable if mama dips hadnt become a tourist hotspot and increased their prices    overrated
consistently mediocre  food  service  and atmosphere  ive been dining here for years  but now that there are so many other better options for indian in ch its time to move on  my waitress tonight had to run to the manager for each question i asked about the menu  basics like  is this dish for 2 people or 1 she repeatedly mumbled answers and then fetched him each time  weird  one of my questions was about the advertised wednesday bollywood nightwhen did it start  turns out that it was in full swing  which basically means they have a movie on mute on a small tv mounted over the bar where hardly any diners can see it  woo    the food is very bland and some things are downright bad  tonight it was as simple as coffee so weak it looked like tea  i ordered a sampler for my main course which came with one teaspoon to serve rice and three entrees  one  lots of scooping ill just leave it at this the food is never as good as their nearby competitors  i want to like this place  but just cant  ive blacklisted restaurants before for bad experiences  but this is the first for consistently mediocre ones
wont be back we arrived at 830  a half an hour before their posted closing time we were promptly told that they were closed  and some excuse about a large party of 8 having arrived or something like that was given this did not make sense their newly expanded dining room was more than half empty id suggest putting up the closed sign promptly if you want to close early
nothing to rate this establishment on beyond its service i arrived postlunch rush to a halfempty restaurant but  since i was alone  was advised id have to share a small twotable configuration with someone else and this despite the fact that there were many empty booths and ample vacant counterspace i needed a bit more room than that for the work id brought with me  but they would not seat me anywhere else   so  i left wont be coming back  either
if i could give fewer stars i would  i recently ordered pad thai to go  and they put it in a styrofaom box  which the pad thai melted and i ended up eating only three bites before having to throw out the food because it tasted so horrible i have given them multiple opportunities  and i have told them about this issue getting pad thai on a normal plate isnt even good its mediocre at best try fresh side if youre interested in good food
generally  i try to be nice about my reviews  but i think i just need to be honest for this one i ordered the tomato basil bisque  which i put in quotes because soup  it was not slop  maybe seriously the worst soup ive had in a long time i also ordered a grilled cheese panini with the soup  and it was almost tasteless i have no idea how you can make a grilled cheese sandwich tasteless  but i think it starts by putting barely any cheese  and maybe no butter gross maybe the other soups are better  but be prepared for an overpriced bowl of nasty soup and a tasteless sandwich
my brother has autism  today  we went to rubys bbq and my brother was acting like his usual self i overheard the workers at the counter at rubys bbq at this location calling my brother retarded and weird of course after that i yelled at them i urge everyone in austin to never go to rubys bbq again the food isnt even that good and remember the r word is incredibly hurtful
there was so much about the spider house that i wanted to like  free wifi not that its useful when you go for drinks  350 frozen margaritas  groovy decor  relaxed feel  etc  but  i had a miserable experience    my buddy and i get there and decide to sit outside  which was cool  first thing i noticed was the neat decor and a pretty relaxed feeling which i enjoyed  however  the taste in my mouth soon soured  after waiting around for about 10 minutes  we flagged down a waiter who let us know that he couldnt take our order because he wasnt sure  but didnt think that we were in his zone or whatever  weird  but sure send over the waiter who is supposed to  about 10 more minutes later and our waitress came over and asks us what we want  i order a margarita and my buddy asks for a beer  15 minutes later  we are drinkless and starting to get pissed  the waitress comes back and goes sorry about that but our computer is down and i forgot your order what did you want again  we give her our order again and wait about 10 more minutes and finally get our drinks    first round of drinks about halfway finished and the waitress comes back and asks us if we want another round  im excited because she came back so early  im thinking if we order now well get our drinks by the time were ready for them  so  we order another round  we literally finish the rest of our drinks and wait around for about 10 more minutes before our waitress comes back and goes  did i bring your drinks already to which we respond no  then about 5 minutes later she comes back and goes you sure i didnt bring you your drinks i could have swore i brought your drinks out  at this point  were pretty steamed  but we hold back and go nope  you didnt  finally she comes out with our drinks and we ask for our check  which we got right about the time we had polished off our second drink paid in cash to avoid sitting for another 15 minutes    all the while that this debacle was going down theyre playing this horrible indie music that literally sounded like a table saw running    needless to say  ill go to trudys across the street any night of the week to spend my money before returning to the spider house
we were at lustre pearl last night  ready for some tacos my boyfriend placed the order and we waited very very very patiently while we thought they were making them a half hour later  we started to ask where our tacos were we ordered only 2 of them  mind you  and we asked a couple times and they kept saying they were on their way over the next 15 minutes  we saw no tacos leave that truck and two workers in the trailer were just standing around not doing much we decided to just ask for our money back and when we did  the guy said well make them for you right now well  you should have made them 45 minutes ago that would have been great  im sure the tacos are wonderful when you actually get them
this place seems to be popular with my fellow cornellians  so i was extra disappointed when we visited  although busy  the place was not full  and two of us had to wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a host and then seated 10 more minutes passed literally  im not exaggerating time here  and we had yet to even see a waitress to ask us for drinks or anything at this point  we went back to the host  and told him we hadnt been attended to he apologized  and he himself took drink orders 5 more minutes passed  no drinks we had both ordered tap water  on top of all of this  the place was filthy floor was not vacuumed  and our table was greasy and filled with debris id love to rate the food  but after 25 minutes and no water  we left and headed to garcias  never having tried  or intending to in the future try this dump
i am giving taste of thai on the commons such a low rating because of the astonishingly nasty service  i have tried multiple times now and it is always the same thing  so i cannot go back  ever again  taste of thai express is much  much better i give them a lot of business and 3 stars  if the owners care at all and if they ever read their reviews  i would respectfully urge them to evaluate their staff at the commons location   i am overly nice when i go out and i tip well i have a great amount of empathy for what service people do because i do it myself but with all the ambivalenttorude service i have now experienced in my travels  i am honestly trying to recall if i have ever been treated with such inexplicable and downright bazaar rudeness with the exception of one nice guy  the staff is weirdly angry and openly hostile do not even think of asking a simple question like  could you please leave out the peas or being so obnoxious as to order tea  believing that maybe you will receive it unless the nice guy is your server how does he stand working there dont they pool tips  taste of thai express has much  much nicer staff and better prices they are always very friendly and helpful and their delivery guys are great the food is good enough that i order frequently  but i think sticky rices is better quality if you are looking for less expensive  taste of thai express is the better value if you like the coconut milk soup tom ka gai tote makes the best for ithaca also  their pad kee mao with pork is quite good greasy  but good the pad thai is tasty inandofitself  but not the best  by a long shot i never order appetizers because they are overpriced by a couple dollars for what you get  it is like much better chinese takeout thai food  i love ithaca  but man is it overpriced we need better quality value places to eat
it is a bad sign when you walk into a place and they have a sign on the table push button for service the two tables that had people in there seemed quite neglected i pushed the button and out came a nice guy  gave me a menu and asked me to sit down  i ordered the cold appetizer combo  with hummus  baba ganoush  grape leaves and taubole i am sure i misspelled most of those the waiter walks into the kitchen and comes out and tells me they are out of grape leaves i ask if i can sub falaful he went into the kitchen and came out and said they were out so i just got double hummus the food was substandard the baba ganoush had no flavor and the taubole was chopped way too coarsely i have had better hummus at vons  it is not a place i plan on going back poor service  poor food  weird set up in the dinning room
this place is a shame    im normally a fan of beard papas  used to have one across the street when i lived in gardena  bliss    not bliss  however  with the one on telegraph  the custard filling was not custard filling  instead  the puff which tasted stale was injected with some sugary  watery concoction that left us with a mess in our hands  simply an unacceptable experience    notwithstanding the fact that papa dont take no mess  he left us with one on saturday night
to the reviews below i will balance the rating out alright by giving one star it deserves none this will be my longest review but i really want to spare my fellow yelpers a horrible dining experience  i got drunk with the guys one night and by bestie bought me chicken and rice  the good friend that she is sadly it was mediocre if only i remembered it was from here  i would have spared muself  and my party  the pain of dining here in person  we went for a friends bday dinner after the restaurant lost his reservation they seated us in the back  and we had our usual banter planning which gay bar to hit that night  bday boy is gay  after all  so i d take one for the team  the waiter left us for 15 minutes  then after placing our orders  i had to hail him at least 5x to inquire as to how much longer wed have to wait for the order apparently the answer was an hour but i kept my temper in check  since it was his day after all  and theres only room for one diva at a table  when the food finally came  all hell broke loose they had bought out the wrong entrees for two we were a party of 10  i had ordered the chicken and rice  see above and declined to eat after the first bite the worst was my vegetarian friend who ordered the veggie burger the lettuce was burnt  a sight i have never seen in my 20 years of dining i mean  you have to be pretty determined to burn lettuce and she had asked for no condiments  but it came slathered in ketchup and some mystery sauce she sent it back and asked for a new one the waiter bought back her new order 5 minutes later  and it was the same burger wed sent back with the sauce scraped off unforgivable  the only saving grace after that was watching the table of 3 women getting drunk a table downsexuallly frustration and 5 rounds of mixed drinks never mix  but bode for free entertainment 
the pizza sucks  and it is a scam against rpi students a slice of gourmet now costs 3  while for 5 at i loves you can get 2 slices and a drink they also wont take any credit cards on anything less than a 5 order  which ive heard is illegal dont go here
ever since george left  my experiences there have been terrible  i went to georges with two others for breakfast a few weeks after the new owners took over the place and they seemed to have no clue how to run the business  i trumped this up to the place being new to them and decided i would try again once they settled into the place  i returned a few weeks later for breakfast and the experience was even worse    the place at the time was incredibly busy and a woman presumably one of the owners was trying to take orders at the counter while serving customers food at their tables  i ordered breakfast and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich  while waiting for our food  the woman was running around frantically trying to squeeze by people getting their coffees and bumping into chairs  i felt incredibly uncomfortable being there  after about 10 minutes  the woman came over with only my boyfriends sandwich  apparently  the grill was backed up  and it would be a few more minutes for my food  fifteen minutes passed before my breakfast came out  meanwhile my boyfriend had already finished his sandwich  while i was waiting for my food to come out  i noticed that people all around were having the same problem  half the table would get food while the other half sat there and watched them eat  i also saw three people send their food back    my order finally came out and the portion size was half of what it used to be for the same price  my eggs were also cold and undercooked  i got half way through my meal when i noticed the scrambled eggs were runny in the middle and i couldnt eat anymore  needlesstosay  the experience ended with a quick walk home and a stop in the bathroom  i would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want an upset stomach  i gave the new owners two chances  figuring they just needed to get into the groove of things  but they didnt seem to get it and unfortunately  i wont be stopping in again to see if they have figured it out
its closed  ughhhhh after walking back and forth we came across this dark  dark place  fail
their foods are gross  however  the place is spacious and you can enjoy watching a big tv so i would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have some korean booze and food with buddies in a quiet setting i hope the owner of ttoust will take over this place  so i can get a much better food in a better setting
okay  i gave this place another try i hadnt been there in a few months its disgusting  tapioca wasnt cooked properly  so it was hard in the middle and too soft on the outside milk tea was completely bland and flavorless think brown water with some chunks of goo  gross i wont be going here again which is tragic because this was my favorite place before the owners changed 
this pizza hut is pretty bad the service is super slow and the pizza doesnt taste good 
what a huge disappointment this place was after reading the yelp reviews  it was like i ate ate a completely different place we went for lunch this past monday it was so bad we couldnt eat our food we left out of there feeling robbed heres the run down brisket was bland  shredded beef tasted like it had been reheated way too many times  pork had an odd taste like it was turning bad  macaroni and cheese dried out  potato salad consisted of mostly celery  and beans were flavorless i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this place hands down the worst bbq ive ever had
having only seen this place from the outside i had previously decided to give it a wide berth it looks like it caters to the young plastic people of america but i finally gave it a chance  easily the worst pizza in town very bland  limp  lame decor is like mcdonalds or walmart trying to be groovy giant plastic surfing hippie and so on filthiest silverware i have ever seen at any restaurant anywhere entertainment provided by deafening fratboy singersongwriters who can neither sing nor write songs my experience there was a waking nightmare which i will shudder to recall for years to come
i have tried and tried to like this place my forebears ate here  back in the day when it had a dirt floor i want to like dirtys  but i cant fool myself any more worst fries anywhere  ever  utterly limp  soaked through and through with stale grease  barely room temperature  taste lousy small malt  mediocre  cost 4 entire front dining room unbearable due to relentlessly loud and obnoxious joking of cooks this place has a primo location and tons of history to bank on  but its always nearly empty too bad
okay for me to go negative publically you have to make me very unhappy  i think throwing up after i ate here for several hours counts  not to mention i was already unhappy about the dine in service having styrofoam plates and cups  the food didnt taste right and by the time i got home it was all over  i am super unhappy that the auschron recommended it dude i trusted you guys and this place was so subpar  next time im going access the street to sun hing  their decor maybe ghetto but the orange chicken is good and i have been eating there for 20 yrs and havent gotten sick  esp if i want average chinese good  you want good chinese then drive to ding ho at 183 and ohlen near the target
after trying it and retrying this place sucks  the yogurt all has a powdery taste to it  the service is less than stellar despite being continuously empty  perhaps i am a bit biased because i strongly prefer real ice cream  but this play is just all kinds of fail with so many good ice cream  ice  gelati  snow cones  and other yogurt shops in austin
not friendly to families if you come here with kids youll get bewildered stares  and ultimately youll not be able to sit together as family we were treated as if we were a bother on a day that wasnt even busy
this place must have the largest costvalue gap in chapel hill you can count on meager  boring  and oddly repetitive dishes at truly astonishing prices the yoghurt drink for 2 is the only thing on the menu that approximates reality there is simply nothing in the food to justify the pretentious bill your server will politely deliver nothing walk down the block to the mediterranean deli for better and more ample fare at 13 the cost wont do this one again
we really wanted to like this place  we are local  we eat and shop local  we want to support local business  so we had a bad meal the ruben was terrible i did not know corned beef could be so bad and the bread was worse  anyway i thought to myself that even in my own place we make mistakes and once in a while the best customer ends up with a poor meal  so we told our waitress why we did not like the food we had eaten maybe a 14 of the food served  if not an 18th  anyway she said  ok and left  that was it  it was ok with her we were served a poor meal  food is not good servers are not well trained or managed decor was nice for a quick service restaurant highly over priced for the quality of the food served  with so many other wonderful local choices black dogs bbq  crane ally  timpones pizza  ricks bakery  cheese  crackers sandwiches and chocolates i have no reason to ever return
the wife and i just came back from hanabi  i hate to give a one star review  but im going to do it here  the food was subpar  but not onestar bad  we ordered a sashimi plate  the chu toro  spicy tuna rolls  seaweed salad  miso soup  none of it was above average  but the chu toro was so chewy we couldnt eat it  on the plus side  it wasnt that pricy at 7  so we felt ok leaving it  the spicy tuna was a little unbalanced  with a smidge too much chili and not quite enough mayonnaise im no mayonnaise fan  but it needs some for texture  some of the rolls that other customers ordered did look very good  but what really made the experience bad was the service  they had two servers and one sushi chef on a friday night  yet they proceeded to seat 30 customers  inside and outside  rather than limit the flow to a manageable number at the door  we had to ask for items  water  check  etc  multiple times   the guy at the table next to us was ignored so many times finally he got really angry and complained to a guy who looked like the owner  who looked totally unsympathetic and pawned him back on the server  another table in the middle of the restaurant started getting angry as well theyd been waiting nearly an hour for their food  we couldnt get a server to take our check because the restaurant was in nearrevolt and the servers were frantically trying to deal    but what was the owner doing  well what would you do  if you said try to clean and set up empty tables so that i could seat more people while avoiding interaction with my customers  then congratulations  you get one gold star  and so does hanabi
is it me or does bobby already have too much money he doesnt deserve more of mine he has an interesting concept enough i think i ordered wrong cause my burger sucked it was too small and burnt i know that sign out there for the weak hearted was for me the one that fears bacterial infections from uncooked red meat   the service was very patient with me so thanks overall too many signs  very confusing the minute you walk it there is the overwhelming graphics of the larger than life menu adhered to the wall those designer out there will like the decor but if youve been smoking too much hash before entering this little establisment you might sht your pants too many options to mess up  just give me a burger the seating if that is limitedyoull have to share at one point with some upenn or drexel fool sharing tables with strangers sometimes gets annoying i never liked that about the melrose dinner either why should i share i avoid septa for that reason  lol just kidding ok this food is lack luster bob  tell me do you not care anymore chipotle doesnt always go with every meal
when you goto this place you gotta realize your in the suck upenn kids as far as the eye can seesweating through the walls  making you itch  when you walk in  the bar area is set up a little funny  its a square bar  but on the back half of the square theres a openminikitchengrillprep stationthing going on but its not like a classy japanese steakhouse openprepstation this is more like a  hey  whats that dirty looking fat guy in raggedy clothes doing with those potskinda station which left me kinda skeptical about what the main kitchen area looks like but anywho  me and the girl got the menu and everything on it looked pretty acceptable  the soup was more than decent  and the greek plate had an out of control amount of feta cheese on it is that good or bad  the girl got the marinated tofu pita and said it was eh and by eh she meant dry and not worth 9 beans it might be one of the better places to eatdrink on upenn campus  but since upenn is a joke  thats not saying much  well probably make it back again since west philly in general is pretty weak when it comes to dining out but im not gonna cut off my tongue with industrial scissors if we dont  alrite   this place used to have three stars  but i just dropped it down to 1  and im completely done here  ive been here atleast 3 other times since the initial reveiw and was disappointed everytime  ugh 
if i believed in a god  i would damn him for creating a being capable of making an establishment like greek lady  this place makes me want to have sex with a chainsaw   i came into this place thinking i was going to be served imitation greek food  but i was dead wrong i was served imitation greek food prepared by a upenn kid usually when i goto a ethnic place to eat i expept someone of that ethnicity to me making the foodmy logic is obviously flawed in this respect one of the nightmarish creations i attempted to eat here was the vegetarian gyroi should of ordered a priest to come with it because this abomination was something that i couldnt handle alone  from the outside it looked alright but on the inside learked something much fouler this vegetarian thing was basically french friesyes  french fries saturated in cucumber yogurt  a hefty ice cream scoop worth lettuce tomato onion inside a pita it was revolting   and i had to toss it  the pepsi i bought was delicious though worth the trip
this is the most unpleasant place ive ever been to in my life  ok  perhaps this reflects on my sheltered existence  but it also is based on the fact that  while waiting patiently to be seated at a table and minding my own business  i was accused by a hostile and frightening waitress of trying to trip her as she went past me  who does this  i am exceedingly nice to waiters and waitresses  bc i know it is a tough job  and i most definitely did not trip this person  i figured i could clear things up with her  but when i went up to the waitress to try to smooth things over  she yelled at me about what a bad person i was for tripping her  what  i mean  i know it is difficult to work at a college hangout like that  but what is wrong with you  who raised you  i was so shocked by this insane and random accusation that we basically left right after that  the person in charge of the wait list watched the whole thing and didnt say a word to me  if mad mex were the last restaurant left  i wouldnt eat there  i just cant believe that restaurants  even college bars  allow their customers to be abused like that  unbelievable  they really do put the mad in mad mex
long wait times they should change their policy and let people share tables like they do in european restaurants  we had the pancakes and steak and eggs meals the pancakes were not tasty at all had a funky taste steak was overcooked and a little tough not sure it was worth the wait
he says  horrible  simply horrible  if your version of chinese food involves a chicken tenders  b red sauce  and c practically raw vegetables then you my friend are in luck  le ahn features all 3  in every one of their chicken dishes  i have had food from there a handful of times twice on my own  because i decided to give a different kind of entree a shot  and twice because different friends had heard a chinese cart around here was good and i had forgotten that this was so bad  beware  steer clear  thar be monsters  she says interesting gingerbased sauce poured on entree  im not an expert on chinese food  but i havent heard of it resembling what this cart serves  for all you health nuts  however  a lot of things are steamed  i think  good luck  his response steamed  subtly steamed
my recommendation what are you doing on this page  this place doesnt exist anymore  this place is closed down now so dont go wandering around ucsd looking for it  alsofood sucked even when it was open
im playing devils advocate here  i know yall think this place is the best thing since sliced bread  especially if its ordinary bread priced 3 times higher than in other stores  but a dose of reality  please  hey  if im looking for organic yak cheese made by hand in nepal by tibetan monks  im going to whole foods  but conventionally grown grapes at 5lb when you can get the same at ralphs for 2 come on  my favorite is the 12lb of peets coffee for 10 when you can buy a full lb at that price next door   and dont get me started on beer  almost all of their beers are available elsewhere at 2 less a 6pack  its pretty sad when seveneleven is cheaper for beer  another huge problem i have with whole foods is their labelling  isnt the whole idea behind this place supposed to be attention to health  so why do almost none of their prepared foods have the dietary contents listed  just because something is organic doesnt mean its good for you  it just means the coroner wont find as many toxins in your cold carcass brought to its demise by a tuna sandwich that had 42grams of fat in it  so i guess part of what bothers me is the attitude of whole foods  it just seems pretentious and insulting beyond belief  im going to sell you the same thing you can get elsewhere and im going to charge you so much more for it youre going to actually believe its better than you can get elsewhere   take a little trip to trader joes or henrys  both of which have organic foods  correct labels  and much better attitudes  having said all that  i really do like whole foods burrito bar     update   before i was playing devils advocate  now im serious  just as i found something at whole paycheck that was actually almost worth it  the burrito bar see last comment above  theyve now stepped over the line  they just switched to charging burritos by weight   there is a whole assortment of stuff you can have put in there and the people behind the counter who are great would make me these fantastic burritos   and they were 599  not bad   but once  by accident  they weighed my burrito at the checkout and it came to almost 12  but most of that weight are things like beans  which are about 1ton  so i just went there and now they are charging by the pound    from a marketing standpoint  this is a disaster  dont they understand that by allowing variable size burritos to be made  they are on the winning side of the ticket  its the all you can eat principle at work  its what the entire midwest food service industry is based on  some people eat a lot more than they should  but some people only eat a little  on average  it all works out  but that wasnt the best part  they are now also charging for condiments  i kid you not  when you buy a sandwich and want to put mustard on it  or soy sauce on your sushi  they charge you by weight for the condiments   they want you to put them in a little paper cup and weight it  pardon my french but you can blow me  there was no way i was not going to talk to the manager about this  and thats when i started to truly despise this place  the manager said that people were abusing the burrito service by putting too many things on their burritos what the fuck does that mean  i reminded her that not only do they advertise that you can put all those things on your burrito  but the customers arent making the burritos  her employees are  but apparently all she had learned in whole foods training school was how to say im sorry you feel that way   but her take on the condiments was truly outstanding   as my buddy d told her  even mcdonalds gives away free condiments  but she said blaming the customers again that people were abusing that privilege too because they take stuff off the shelves and use that as condiments  hey  thats not a problem with the condiments  thats just stealing  i told her  thats a security issue  then she said that they are losing money on the condiments  so d asks her  well  how much extra money are you losing by now requiring people to use all those little cups  and thats not exactly environmentally sound  is it  her well thought out response to this was im sorry you feel that way and thats when i realized she was just full of shit  any place that is charging approximately double the price for the same items you can buy at trader joes is not losing money  theyre just losing customers like me  and their arrogance is unbounded
i havent been back to this place in ages see first review for reason but perhaps a few years was enough time to make a few improvements  but it was not to be   for the appetizer we ordered the spinach cheese dip  this may have been the worst appetizer ive ever had  it was a bowl of liquid cheese  there were some green specks i can imagine might have been spinach and a very few pieces of something at the bottom of the bowl  but really it was just a slimy mess  it was horrific  for my main dish i thought that id ordered the ahi sandwich  which i assumed was a big piece of ahi  because thats what it is everywhere else on the planet  but it was just a pile of low grade ahi scraps obviously trimmed away from a real piece of ahi  and the magician in the kitchen had found a way to extract all flavor from those scraps  it tasted like pegboard  and for 12 do me a favor an throw that garbage on some kind of real bread  not the cheap hamburger bun like i used to use for picnics  now that i live downtown  my beer palette has been significantly honed by the many great beer venues neighborhood  etc  the ipa on the cask  no less was so thin  flavorless  and weak that it was pretty close to a pint of flat cocacola  just awful  and just for a little emphasis  my beer came cold and my friends beer came warm  and sticking with their policy of denial  the waitress said well  i saw the bartender pour them one after another  this place really is the ultimate in corporate restaurant mediocrity
one of the first bands i ever heard on the radio when i was young was styx and i figured that must be rock music because they had guitars and a drum  of course  it didnt take long before i realized that they were as close to a rock band as kenny g is to a jazz musician and now id rather listen to someone jackhammering a cat than a styx album  live and learn  right  so just because bread is round and has a hole in it  doesnt make it a bagel  bagels are by definition boiled in water  and they need to be made fresh in the morning  einstein bros bagels are neither  theyre just round  stale bread  if youre having trouble wrapping your head around this  do the following test  by way of analogy  go to piattis and order pasta  but bring along a can of chef boyardee spaghetti os  when your meal comes  take a bite  then take one from chef bs can and tell me you think thats spaghetti
they have to put the word mexican in their name because you would never guess it by taste  hell  you wouldnt even guess it was food if the items werent shaped like things you vaguely recognize from real restaurants   and could you design a place with worse ambience if youre in the bar area it feels like youre eating in someones attic  or barn way to make the most of the prime location in la jolla next to ucsd  which is already a barren wasteland for restaurants  id crawl through the four lanes of traffic to eat at the chevron station across the street before i ate here  hey  can i have the stale chips with pureed tomato salsa to start  then some nondescript flavorless meatlike substance wrapped up in a desiccated leathery tortilla  followed by a gigantic bowl of margarita mix to wash it down  suhweet
worst persian restaurent in la
it is my opinion that this place make some pretty freakin bad pizza  and bad salad now granted  ive only had pizza delivered  so maybe its better when you have it in the restaurant my company had some pizza delivered  and i had a piece of the buffalo chicken pizza which first of all looked completely unappetizinglike it had been sitting out for a while and congealed  and second  tasted awful   just horrible  it actually tasted to me  like someone had dumped a bunch of chemicals on the pizza instead of buffalo flavoring   the salad that came with our delivery was an entire tray filled to the brim with iceburg lettuce  on top of the huge pile of iceburg lettuce were about 6 slices of tomato  cucumber and green pepper  that thats it  that can hardly qualify as a salad to top it all off  i ate this pizza at 12 noon and my stomach has been killing me ever since  i am convinced that there is something wrong with the buffalo pizza   justdont go here  there is no point when there are so many other places that are so very much better
bad dont even deserve 1 star but i had to in order to continue with my post  i go to starbucks all the time  at fresh pond  church st  broadway  mass ave towards porter  or kendall sq  never to this one and well keep it that way i visited this particular one  on saturday 426 in the early afternoon  after a light walk in the rain  thought i would treat myself shouldve gone to one of my regular spots it was a typical day at starbux  a short line but many people hanging out i ordered the new pike place blend but decaf with steamed milk  a misto  if you will ive been getting decaf for a while now since i recently developed a strange reaction to caffeine due to asthma and im currently pregnant i know that no decaf is really decaf but i need to regulate my intake well  someone else ordered the same misto but regular  made me nervous when the drinks were called out  i asked the barista if she was sure mine was the decaf  she answered confidently yes and  ms regular misto took her drink i  still not convinced  lifted the cup to see what was marked on the cup like every starbux does to identify the drinks  but nothing was marked sign number 2 i didnt want to be a pain and have them make me a new one  but ive learned my lesson now i drank it  walked home and started palpatating my breathing was erratic  i was shaking   and i had to take a medicine to counteract the effects i was having it was scary i made sure i called the manager the next day when i was more calm but of course the manager gave a insincere apology and his voice didnt show any emotion i was so so so disappointed i will never return there  i have sent an email to the corporate office because you expect so much from them im not even sure i want to go back to any starbux now  maybe i should just stick to the local little cafes and save money at the same time
yuck anyone that thinks this is ice cream has never had any being pregnant and having so many cravings  my husband and i have learned we must act fast when  one comes on  so we happen to be on a walk through harvard sq and walked by lizzys  went in and notices blackberry ice cream  yum purchased the half gallon to have some later at hometook a few spoonfuls and eeewwwww its just cream no flavor whatsoever its just cream with food coloringand they charge you like its haagendazs  thats what i get for going to a little guy or gal in this case for ice cream ill stick to baskin robbins if im ever confronted with a craving for ice cream in harvard sq again
we ended up here after finding that all of the other places we wanted to go to were full  dont be fooled by the romantic tables at the front of the restaurant with table cloths and a nice view  the interior tables were very close together with cold metal surfaces  the food was soso and definitely not worth the price  portion size was small  service was good  you can do much better in princeton for the same money
the mexican food is not so good the spices are off and oddly mixed the quality of the food is ok at best the food is prepared without gloves  which makes me uneasy
i was dying for this place to open  its located right between my apartment and the office  ive given it three chances and was disappointed each time  the atmosphere is great  its clean and airy and the people are generally very friendly  its the food and coffee that could be much better  in fairness  i only ordered the toasted bagel and cream cheese and a latte each time  similar to my experience at many cafes downtown  they do not know how to choose or prepare a good bagel  why does every place insist on toasting it and then covering it while hot in foil  dont they know its going to turn to mush  im not sure it mattered anyway as its more like a hamburger bun than the way a bagel is meant to be  the latte was nothing special  id rather walk out of my way to find something better  why ruin a morning ritual with bland food
this place has got the shittiest service on planet earth most of the staff that work there are either rich hipster kids looking for another source of income to snort their coke or retired rockstars who still talk about that one big show they played most of the staff here are rude and dont pay attention to you if you are not wearing the latest line from american apparel i came to spiderhouse before they had a full bar and had their shitty wait staff  it was way better back in the days where there were no pretentious pricks stareing at what you are wearing back in the day  you came to spiderhouse  ordered your drink inside and just took it outsideinside to chill now  if you try to order inside  i am usually directed by the rude staff that there are waiterswaitress outside to take our orders ive been forced to go outside several times and one time i literally sat there for 30 minutes before anyone paid us any attention this just doesnt happen to me  it happens to all of my friends and other people that have been there ive had several friends that have worked at spiderhouse and it is fair for me to say that they spend most of their time chatting to their friends who came to spiderhouse instead of taking orders from customers   the only positive about the current spiderhouse that i still like is their design its very well done and they do have good vegetarian food but if you are vegan there is not much of an option their alcoholic drinks are good  i suggest the spider cider with a shot of rum in it as far as regular drinks  my favorite is their raspberry sunset
chicken in my vegetarian dish
yuck this place sucks the food is gross  ranging from tasteless and soggy to overly salted and just nasty the only times that i go to this place is as an unwilling participant in some sort of group outing even their drinks are gross   if you are a college student who wants to get so wasted that you dont even taste your food because believe me you dont want to then by all means go to trudys   the service too  is just ok
closed in 2011 pulled up stakes in the middle of the night leaving staff  longtime customers in the lurch theres a rumor they may be reopening one of the closed stores soon i wont be patronizing them ever again  btw  this app wont allow you to post with 0stars  i tried
i was having dinner with my roommate and when she left to go to the bathroom the waitress started a staring contest with me wtf
i actually finally complained after a checker didnt use a cupon that was on an item i bought  he said since i didnt present it to him he didnt ring it up with it  the customer service person said the manager was busy  i told him he just said sorry  didnt ask my name or number for her to get back to me  i then felt that he wouldnt bother to tell the manager so i wrote them a note  the manager never responded to my complaint and so i did go to a different safeway  to all you yelp people i got much better treatment by staff at the safeway at rosovelt location so if you want one close by go to that one  its bigger  cleaner  friendlier staff and i think ill go there when i go instead of the other one to safeway  just really sad the service at this store  dont waist your money and shop somewhere else
id eyed this place for several months and wanted to try it  but for one reason or another did not  well  i finally did and wished i had walked on by  it was one of the worst values ever  i thought morimotos was bad for the money this place was worse and the prices were near morimotos in philly  my seafood teriyaki was around 21 and it had 4 jumbo shrimps the best thing on the plate  and 5 scallops which you can tell that it was really one sliced into 5 pieces  and 3 slices of white fish each about the size of 2 fingers  it came with blanched vegetables that were difficult to eat because it was basically raw with no taste  and the string bean spine had not been peeled  so i had to spit it out  if you like bland tasteless food or need to eat such because you are nursing an ulcer  this is the place for you  uhg  never again  nice little cozy place though  thats about it  almost forgetthe mango lobster salad for 10 was good but you only get about 1 index finger sized of lobster  the salad comes in a martini glass so imagine how little you get   lobster prices these days are crazy low  i mean you can get a whole cooked 125 lb lobster in chinatown for 10  wtf
i only come here once in a blue moon  this is one of my least favorite restaurants because the food isnt that great  however  i always like to come here once a year or two just to remind myself why i dont like coming here and eating here couple days ago reminded me again the reasons  so  my boyfriend and i came here because we were both hungry  we havent ate all day and we wanted food quickly we didnt want fast food and we wanted to go to a sit down restaurant  knowing how busy places get around 7ish  we decided to come here because in la jolla  this place is the least packed restaurant  we even drove by bjs  tgif  etc    our wait on a friday night at 7 pm was 25 mins  as we were waiting i saw a table get cheddar cheese fries 695  295 additional for chili  seriously that much just for chili  totally overpriced and boy did it look good  so when we finally got seated that is what i ordered  i also ordered a pina colada drink 7  my boyfriend ordered sliders  7 and mai tai drink 7  as we were sitting there waiting for our food it came out 20 minutes later yes granted the fact that the place was busy  it doesnt justify the fact that it took 20 minutes just to get two appetizers  on top of that  it took another 5 minutes  so a total of 25 minutes  to get our drinks because they forgot about it  wow seriously bad service   in addition to the lag in service  our food was gross  my fries was not what i saw before  it was stale  some were hard crispy  cold  and there were little cheese  the cheese also was melted but it was cold and hard  you could tell they left it out for a while before they served it  the sliders were okay i wasnt as impressed it was only okay because we made it to be okay by adding more sauce and etc  overall for a meal that was 30 its wasnt satisfying  update 1216  i was going through my pictures because i love looking at them i know im silly and i so happened to check islands to see my food pictures and they took it off their yelp site is that even possible if so   how rude they only kept one persons picture that gave them a good rating   on top of the worst service and bad food  this really topped it  poor sportsmanship   update 1231  okay so they put my pictures back up  thanks islands i very much appreciate it
bad business move   i was a regular at doodles until today  i talked this place up to friends  coworkers  and family i really did heartdoodles now  they jacked up their prices and changed their menu unfortunately  they changed the quality of the flavoring too on top of that  the guy behind the counter was rude this all adds up to not good sadly  this will most likely be my last visit to doodles 
ive ordered from sliders twice and both times i was really disappointed  the first time  they screwed up my order  twice i was let down by the menu to begin with  since one of the best parts of belgian fries is the sauces  but for the most part their selections are very ordinary plain ketchup  bbq  hot sauce  etc between my friends and i  we ordered burgerssliders which were just decent  fries  a number of different sauces so wed have variety despite the options being quite ordinary  and were delivered a completely different selection of sauces than what we had ordered i called sliders to request that they deliver the correct sauces and they delivered a bag with our order correctly handwritten on it yet with another seemingly random collection of incorrect sauces inside we gave up the fries were bland and oily anyway and bore little resemblance to authentic belgian fries ive eaten in the past  the second time  i tried to give sliders another chance by ordering a burger and a slider  since the burger had been the only decent component of my meal the first time  and it was awful the bottom of the burger was not only sort of charred  but absurdly  horribly salty i love salt but i found this barely edible a burger this bad from a cheap burger place wouldnt be as disappointing  but this was 5 to start plus they charge you extra for cheese and some other toppings including the jalapenos  which were not very good jalapenos  all heat  no flavor the slider was a little better but nothing special  and seemed more like a tiny burger than a proper slider anyway overall  too much money for really lousy food
do not come here if you are in a large group  the food is okay  as usual  but the service was so shitty   we came in a large group and were pressured to sit down and get our orders taken for a fixed gratuity  of course fine  whatever but when we asked the waitress if she could split the bill amongst 4 cards as we had no cash on us  it was like asking for her firstborn she informed us in this nasty  awful tone that she had told us if we wanted to pay separately we were to do it at the counter when she did no such thing and that she would do it this time but next time we had better at which point we politely told her how much we appreciated it and handed her our cards uh  hello  werent you the one who chirpily told us to inform you if we wanted it split a different way as you handed us the bill stupid wench never coming here again for my mediocre pasta ill take gypsys gruff cashier guy anyday
800 for a burger combo and no cheese   cmon son
i had the misfortune of going to this restaurant for pancakes they were swimming in frying oil  all shiny they were very very disgusting i ordered tea  which meant lipton in lukewarm water before ordering pancakes  i asked for eggs but changed my mind when i found out that they do not have whole wheat toast what kind of breakfast place only has white bread my server was nice the ambiance was stuck up and pretentious with nothing good to show for it i live above this place  and im never going back
im giving this place 1 stars only because i want this review to stand out maybe the business can read it and do something about it   the bagels here are great  they are absolutely delicious  theres no doubt about thattheir cream cheese is also of high quality   but my problem has been during the ordering phase of the bagels about 40 of the time  ive received a misunderstood order either the bagel or the cream cheese was wrong the staff doesnt speak much english  and the way they have organized the line is quite inefficient that it becomes very painful to order for example today  it took me 10 minutes to get a small container of veggie cream cheese because the staff kept telling me to order the cheese over there they kept ping ponging me for cream cheese the service is awful  but the bagels are the best ive tasted in manhattan
the food was not good  for all of the pretense and egotism  they serve animals on the menu that should not be considered food  even by carnivores  i have to say i had high hopes for gather  but after following their menu for a while  i was sorely disappointed
different strokes for different folks i get it some people like their pizza ny style others like theirs loaded with goodies personally  i like mine fatty and filling my food mantra  really but i truly dislike fat slices brand of fatty and filling my pepperoni slice was all tasteless bread  cheap cheese  grease and no sauce or flavor to speak of and lets not even discuss the disruptive bowel movements that followed my lunch here not worth saving a few dollars when you have other cheap options on telegraph  also janky as hell i love me a grungy place  but the foods gotta be good  ya dig
cheap  yet ohsotasteless  save your 2 and go somewhere else  i had the falafel  and it was cold and tasted like nothing  or burnt  yuck  i also had the tabbouleh  and it was weird  it was more cucumber and tomato bits than actual tabbouleh  along with a shitload of parsely  cheapoh  i might try a meatsome kebob  but after that tanks like i expect it to  i will never venture here again  plus  the counter people were dicks aug 26 2008  this place is clearly for poor college students with no money and even less taste    aside rant i have to say  i fucking hate how less than mediocre restaurants survive in big places  where there are enough people with money or bad taste to frequent them  even though the food tastes like shit  fuck you college students  ugh
i am not very sure why people come here  you are in berkeley and there are a million other choices to make  even regarding indian food  and for some reason i felt compelled to walk through the doors  i might have given this place 2stars based soley on taste  but the guy at the counter was rude  there was no atmosphere which i wasnt expectingbut i digress  and the portions were smaller that i have had for similar prices at other  better  restaurants  did i mention to cockroach hanging out on the trash can on the way to the bathroom  maybe the reason i didnt eat the food was because i lost my appetite  i wont be coming back
overpriced and pretentious  this is gotta be a joke  right  how could berkeley students call this best burgers  fries  the airbaked fries taste like cardboard  the burgers are healthy  with the whole wheat buns and all  but they charge 75 cents to refill your soda wtf free refills are standard now  dickwads  next time ill find the nearest in n out  or maybe trek a little farther to that great little burger joint in el cerrito
this place was terrible bad decor and bad lighting aside  the food was pretty bad one of us had the bulgogi  which was oversweet and pretty fatty i had the grilled mackerel  which was clearly frozen  dry and chewy the kids shared the japchae  which was soupy and blah the miso soup was emptyjust miso and scallions the one nice part was that they gave us shumai on the house for the girls overpriced toohad we paid for the 6 shumai  it would have been 695 bulgogi was 1895 wont be back
had the same experience as the other two reviewers this morning  sadly we woke up craving pancakes  and since our kitchen is packed to move  we decided to give it a try we were lucky enough to get a table quickly  but had to snag a passing waitress after 10 minutes to get menus the kids got chocolate milk  which was not wellstirredforgivable i had the eggs benedict  and was sorely disappointed by the thomas english muffin  thin hollandaise that tasted like it was powdered mix  all topped with dried parsley flakes the 2 slices of applewood bacon were okay  dont most places give you 3 my partner had french toast  which was flavorless the 2 pieces of brown n serve sausage were sent back  as they were burnt the replacements were devoured by my younger daughter  just like the brown n serves we have at home  for less money our older daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes  which were more like crepesthey were edible  just nothing to write home about   service was pretty bad  the guy owner seemed annoyed about having to seat people at one point  after having to feed our younger daughter 3 clementines because the food took so long  she had dropped a piece  which the owner picked up with a glower   needless to say  we wont be back  i wish id have stayed home and unpacked the measuring cups and made my own pancakes
i loved bite mi when it first opened  ive never had any other vietnamese sandwiches  so for the price  i thought it was great    okay  but today  and somebody please respond and tell me it was some vegetable that resembles hair  but today  i got the bar b que pork  or chargrilled as its now called  and i noticed stringy  hairlike things  at first i thought it was just the pork shredding  then i thought it must be some sort of leafy vegetable sprout  but i finally pulled one out for closer inspection  and it was a coarse  short hair  black at the tip and blondish brown on the other side  and i pulled out like four more  short  stiff hairs off the top of my meat  was this pork hair  what was i eating  i get that  in the scheme of things  its really not any more gross than eating meat as a whole  but its the idea of how they may be preparing their food that really got to me  i didnt really want to think too much about it  so i just threw the rest away  two hours later i have a bad stomach ache  likely not related to pig hairs  but perhaps linked to some other nefarious cooking practices  i am very open to someone enlightening me as to what it possibly was in my sandwich  i still cannot believe it was tufts of piggy  the cashier was really friendly  though
i am sorry  the service here is always awful  and im used to it  but about ten months ago i had the worst waitress she forgot to take our orders  she didnt put our orders in right away  our food took forever to get  we never saw her after that  well you would think  ten months later that waitress would be gone  fired  kaput  removed from the ranks of kerby lane after what is probably a very lengthy process of pushing out the crap judging by how consistently awful our servers are  oh no  though  we had her again  but i didnt look toward our night with dread  at least this time she was chipper and pleasant  so who knows  it could have been an off night our previous time  turns out  it wasnt  after quickly taking our drink order and very quickly bringing them out  we needed more then 45 seconds to look at the menu  she promised shed be back  15 minutes later i was pulling dollars out of my purse to pay for our drinks and leave  right as i was about to put it on the table she came rushing up  apologizing  she took our order  but then  instead of putting in our order  she took the order of someone who just walked in  they wanted coffee  so she obliged and got it for them  then she took other peoples orders  then she chilled in the back for awhile  and then a oh shit look crossed her face and it got put in  20 minutes later  our food arrived  of course  she put the order in wrong  meat instead of the veggie option for the pasta  the kitchen yells at her  she is heard audibly apologizing  she continues to apologize to us  1015 minutes go by  and the new meal arrives  except it isnt new  the pasta is hardened and dried along the edges of the dish  and the mushroom is the only thing piping hot  they had simply taken the chicken off and replaced it with mushrooms  is that even legal i dont care if it is  its stupid and gross  food sat out for 15 minutes getting gross  and then not to mention who knows what our dietary restrictions could have been  that is unacceptable  i dont want food to go to waste  but regardless  if kerby didnt employ such dependably awful workers maybe this place could be a little better  i am never going back to kerby lane  and man  its been a long time coming
ok  another bad geovantis experience  again  this time i ordered a famous calzone however  the servbice is still sooo slow aprrox 15 mins after my order  i asked the guy on the cashier about the situation  and he told me back itll be ready in 2 mins and after another 15 mins  he said the calzone is ready gee  also  i do not recommend you to go there for a dinein dinner  coz people usually have a party in downstairs and make noise your dinner would become a disaster  ps the taste of calzone is nearly perfect  but it doesnt change my thoughts about this place  thumbs down again unfortunately
jumping on the tart frozen yogurt bandwagon swirlberry is the alsoran in the ann arbor area  i sampled the blueberry and lemonade flavors both were grainy and neither were tart they tasted mostly sweet with hints of real lemon and blueberry flavors the lemonade flavor was pink  the concept is selfserve and you pay by weight only one largesize cup is provided very easy to overindulge without realizing it the lack of choice could lead to waste  the soft serve machines and topping bar looked neat and well maintained  the state street location is cramped and painted in headache inducing colors the dining area is up a short flight of stairs and i didnt see any wheelchair access music was loud when i visited so conversation with friends may be difficult  i will stick with yogobliss
my partner and i have finally learned our lesson and stopped going even when the urge for seafood is strong the real seafood company is main streets seafood themed restaurant its not so much for eating as it is for looking the last time we went was on a friday and even on a friday my selection was not fresh maybe it was because it took so long to get to the table every time ive been there i have felt unwelcome and i leave thinking i would have had a better meal at red lobster
i had the grilled cheese with bacon  tomatoes  and grilled onions  it was okay 2 points for that i asked for no butteroil on the bread and they listened 5 points for that  i am not a fan thick fat french fries minus points for that my friend had the ruben sandwhich  she said it was good  but i think it looked nasty the food is average prices are average the drinks are weak i had two jack and diets and my friend had  several seagram and diets and they were all weak we just want a good drink they did not know how to make a whiskey drink or they are just being cheap if you go here just order beer i will never go back here i ordered whiskey because it was halloween and i wanted a real drrrinnk  and their drinks were like cola minus minus points for weak weak drinks on halloween cmon now
if i can give negative stars  i would   where did this place get their stars   first  their sangria is from cvs or costco the kind you buy at a grocery store premade then they cut up some orange slices and thats it   their brie cheese is cold and nasty  crackers are the kind you eat when you are pregnant or feeling sea sick   this place is a joke
i am astounded  appalled  and flabbergasted that people would review this place highly honestly  im not being overly critical its just that im chinese ive come to this place  several timesnot by choice group events  and every single experience here has been disappointing the wonton soup that comes with the meal is just water and lotsa pepper and the wonton ill save my breath for that the kungpao chickn is redand by that you know that its not made correctly not even spicy just sweet and sour all over sweet and sour sweet and sour sweet and sour i know i know  its cheap and its fast what can i expect but honestly  thththat does not mean it can taste like this  runs away sobbing
this store is a good study in how a culmination of small things makes a big difference basically  this is a poor mans panera i really want to like it since i live in the area and theres no panera nearby  but after a few visits ive written the place off most of the problems have been documented alreadytasteless soups  poor staffing  sovieterastyle bread counters  untidynessbut the main thing is that it all adds up to a place i dont want to spend much time in perhaps other stores are better ive noticed some variation in panera quality too  but nothing that has sunk as low as this store
this was my first time going to an atlanta bread company  and i must say that i was really disappointed with this place  first of all  it seemed that every table i saw was dirty and needed to be cleaned as well as the seats  i ended up ordering the chargrilled chicken pesto panini and it was not good at all  there was very little chicken in it  and the pesto was not very flavorful  i also order the pasta salad  and that was disappointing as well  the salad was mediocre  the free internet was not working  and the list goes on  as you know  first impressions are everything  and i dont think i want to ever go back to an atlanta bread company
i went here and this place looks like it is closed for business  the sign was not up anymore
of all of the jamba juices ive been to in the east bay ie all of them  this one is by far the worst as far as customer service every one of their employees seem lazy  miserable and rude   its 700pm and youve already shut down your carrot juice machine even though you close at 800pm and therefore cant make carrot juice too lazy to clean it again   oh please  ill just goto the emeryville one  where theyd be happy to make me a damn carrot juice a minute before they close
ew  i was sitting there reading quietly downstairs towards the front of the cafe  when all of a sudden at the corner of my eye  i see something move i thought maybe it was just me hallucinating but when i did a doubletake  it was a mouse  i immediately hopped out of my chair along with my belongings and left this place for good this place is obviously a dirty shithole  im sure theyre not the only place around berkeley infested with mice  but come on now  if you have mice lurking around there  imagine what lurks in your food   gross
i came here for a chicken vindaloo and all i left with was a stomach ache and a whole lot of toilet action
queue the violins  because this is a sad one  for our one year anniversary  my man and i decided to celebrate at upstairs on the square  we were so jazzed about the lauds they had received on their vegetarian tasting menu and couldnt wait to indulge in too many courses and much champagne  i booked the reservation on open table with a note that we were celebrating an anniversary and would like a quiet table  with the highest of hopes  we arrived in harvard square and were sat at a table in the middle of the room  i asked to be moved  but it was no use  as that night wassports trivia night   the dining room with the tasting menu was closed for the private party and we were forced to endure drunken idiots on one side and a loud trivia announcer on the other  to add insult to injury  the food was awful  ive only heard good things  but my striped bass was nothing but fishy  while my bfs pasta was hardly cooked at all crunchy  we had to laugh and give in to the idea thatd wed simply need a redo on the romantic evening and that it will be hard for us to even think about going back to upstairs  my main gripe is this  its cool if they have a sports trivia event  and most of the people there were enjoying it  but if i ask for a romantic table  call me and let me know that that evening will be utterly unromantic  perhaps if they had paid a little more attention to the reservation request  they would not have lost this ladys interest
mkay long story short  the broad i dealt with at the counter has a demon first she takes my order  which was for a lasagna slice and a drink i paid with discresh hey sc people who know what that is and it is  i guess  a lengthy process of swiping and punching things in so she gives me the receipt to sign and then says it will be out in a minute and that was it so after a beat  im like and  my drink and shes like i didnt charge you for a drink as if thats my fault then  upon realizing id be using discresh again she angrily goes just forget it and gives me what amounted to a free watereddown sprite because the frustration of punching in another discresh order was clearly too much for her fragile psyche  if that wasnt bad enough  she brings my lasagna to my table and its hard and cold in the middle except for the melted cheese on top disgusting  boooooooooooooo
ive been twice now  with high hopes only to be dramatically let down pasta roma  you do not impress me not at all people say its cheap but for the quality of the food you get  i think its expensive the marinara sauce is boring  the salad is far from fresh  and the chicken in the chicken parm sandwich i had was thin  tasteless  and dry you know what else is thin  tasteless  and dry thats right  cardboard with a million restaurants on fig  i cant imagine coming here again
dont ever order a javatogo from this coffee bean i have ordered on three separate occasions for our office meetings and they are never ready at pickup time we always order a day before and have been let down time after time the staff at this location act like they are doing you a favor never again starbucks on hoover is our new location
as i work in the mall  close to cocola  i sometimes would go in if there wasnt a line four out of the six or seven times ive order a sandwich grilled cheese or tomatobasilmozzarella  as im a lactovegetarian  animal flesh has somehow made it onto my plate and even in my sandwich um  if i wanted animal flesh  i would have ordered it  right  tonight was the last straw i went in  ordered a grilled cheese  expecting nothing but a grilled cheese and a scoop of their dry potato salad when the girl is finally done grilling it  she pops it in the togo box i checked it out and noticed something really off there was ham in my grilled cheese now  i know that they have a button for grilled cheese with ham  and the cashier didnt press that button she pressed the regular grilled cheese button so  i clarified that i didnt order the ham what does she do she says  okay  i can take the ham out if you want with a um  say what look on my face  i told her that im a vegetarian  id rather my grilled cheese not taste like ham so  she asked  what do you want me to do  make a new one i said  go for it  or you can just give me back my money she then proceeded  in complete confusion  to try to take the ham out and give me that sandwich so  i said  i am so sorry for being a difficult btch  but  please make me the sandwich i ordered  if you really must eat there  go earlier in the day the more competent staff seem to work before 3pm and  dont order anything but espresso drinks and pastries the food  service arent worth the money youll be spending
just because oprah loves sprinkles doesnt mean they are the best cupcakes in the world really folks  oprah is not god  allah  jesus  the dalai lama  or your great grandmother  sure the cupcakes are semidecent but  the money and caloric intake of each cupcake is not worth it most people who are halfway decent in the kitchen can make cupcakes just as good if not better what makes homemade cupcakes different a ton of money is saved  along with the security of good nutrition when someone is in control of their own baking  they can control how much sugar and fat is used  but  please  go there if you love oprah and want to pay her bills  are not willing to bake your own cupcakes  spend 200 extra  and dont care that one cupcake equals an entire meal that probably will have much more protien and fiber in it
service is slipping  i frequent this particular starbucks often and i was appalled when my family of 6 recently stopped in  apparently dropping 6 coffee orders on them was overwhelming these guys better not move to chicago or new york any time soon if they cant handle 6 coffees what really chaffed me was the fact that they got one of the orders wrong and my adult son courteously pointed out that his order was incorrect  the barista proceeded to instruct him on what he had ordered instead of owning up to the mistake  he took what she made him without making a scene but what happened to the customer is always right  ps  he orders the same thing every time so i know she messed it up
i love a basic diner as much as the next girl  but this place is really bottomofthebarrel right near the fox  they cover the walls with playbills and posters and assume the decor will overshadow the fact that the food is overpriced and tasteless  ill admit it my friend and i had a few drinks at engine 11 before we hit broadway diner for a latenight dessert and soberingup session but usually  predrinking makes food taste better  not worse  they were out of the cake we wanted  but we eventually settled on an oreo cake i mean  how badly can you screw that up its chocolate  cream  and cake apparently  you can screw it up decently badly the dessert was stale  flavorless  and nearly inedible  with a moderately hefty price tag of 5 the service was okay while we were there  but when we left  our waitress was crouching outside the restaurant smoking a cigarette classy  all in all  not a place ill be going back to i tried not to judge a book by its cover but in this case  i should have im going to engine 11 next time
it has recently come to my attention that there is an homage to lulus in fallout 3  which makes sense  as the postapocalypse is the only setting in which i could imagine myself enjoying their food  the food ranges from the barely mediocre chinese to a few perverse interpretations of panasian fare  for example  their pad thai  which is a soupy  syrupysweet  noodley mess  they even somehow manage to spoil the simple pleasure of bubble tea their tea is heavy  and seems to be creamed with coconut milk which seems like a good idea until youve had two sips and are full
over priced  bad food and worse service  in fact the food was indistinguishable from bad chinese food
i was never a particularly big fan of lulus  but after my most recent visit i dont really have any interest in returning my boyfriend and i ordered drinks waters  diet coke and then quite a while later  the waitress returned to take our food order without bringing drinks a good while passed during which no one even came to check on us so that we could remind them that we needed drinks  then our food arrived without drinks  i ordered a vegetable dish in which tofu is offered as a replacement for meat the dish arrived with about four small pieces of tofu the vegetables were bland and salty i left hungry  the prices arent bad  but it really shows in the quality its not one of those holeinthewall  wellkept secret type place there is a reason why the prices are cheap the food is not plentiful nor high quality  and the service is terrible the only thing really going for it is the bubble tea  im really laid back about waitresses being busy  but there were not many people in the restaurant and we didnt get our drinks until our meals were nearly finished
i whish i could rate this place no stars 45 for 2 dishes and satay  carry out you got to be kidding me   small portions and the food was below average at best  long story short  i know thai and this aint it i think the location and the lack of anything like it in around keeps this place open cause i know the food cant be doing the trick for them  moved here from chicago and this falls way short of the worst thai place back home
the staff is nice  but their product is consistently terrible and watery for whatever reason  the seating looks like a nice enough place to chill  but given the alternatives ive never been particularly driven to do so
facts won is a chinese place that also serves some korean dishes   cons the main purpose of won is to feed the hungry in university city and fill them up it does just this do not expect food quality much above one of the chinese food trucks luckily  prices are about as moderate if you find yourself inside wons and wonder how you got there  then have the hot and spicy korean seafood soup  but please  only if you can eat spicy if you go for lunch  try to take the afternoon off food tends to be a little bit greasy  so you might not be able to move for a while  pros they have chinese fortune cookies with words of wisdom and lucky numbers
i used to go here a lot in terms of italian  i think it has the best italian food in pittsburghprice  however  their is a new waiter there that is extremely pushy i used to get an appetizer to share with a friend and an entree  but the waiter would push dessert  when we refused  he would be curt he was so pushy for during every course  encouraging us to get the most expensive thing on the menu  even though we already decided on entrees he also was not present much  except to make us feel uncomfortable   i was unpleasantly surprised to discover that he is now a regular there he has consistently made my visits there so unbearable that i will never be returning
got moussaka instead of bechamel  they put american cheese on topinteresting  cheap and not a tasty choice so much lamb on the menu  its hard to avoid just because it has lamb in it  doesnt mean its mediterranean friend had beef platter beef too dry  too well done for this price  you could get a lot better would not recommend
this place is all about sake bombing and is usually frequented by college students many times underage who are looking to sake bomb and party last night  dynamite was blasting and there were people jumping around and singing at 1110 pm this is not a place where you can have a quiet and tasty japanese dinner the dishes are hit or miss  the rolls are quite small and they are a bit on the more expensive side the fish ive had has always been pretty fresh  so no complaints there  and the tempura is tasty but i know a lot of things are not good at all i only go here to drink because its like a really loud bar its a bit expensive and im pretty sure someone vomited under a table there yesterday it was extremely loud and obnoxious
please dont waste your time here ive lived in univ city for a while and ive always contemplated going here to try the sushi or korean fare i once tried a bubble tea from it and although it took them years to make it and it was very overpriced  i liked it  i ordered a shrimp shumai dumpling to start the taste was really good  but it was served lukewarmthese either had been sitting around for a while or they were not reheated very well disappointment  next up  my friend ordered the hot stone bi bim bap and i ordered the veggie bi bim bap the appearance was nice  the egg was runny  but it just had absolutely no flavor nothing on the plate had flavor the kimchi on the side was fine  but neither the tofu nor the riceveggies had any flavor at all nothing had salt  everything just kind of tasted the same we added hot sauce but it just wasnt hot enough we asked for their real hot sauce and they said they had noneit was so disappointing we had originally wanted sushi but the sushi bar was closedwe went with these overpriced dishes we didnt even like or finish and walked out with a bad taste in our mouths  besides the fact that the food is not good  the ambiance can only be described as bizarre there was only one waiter for lunch on saturday and only 3 other guests it seemed like the restaurant lights were off for the most part in an effort to save energy  maybe  one other table was working in the back  and it just looked generally sketchy the service was not great and it was way too expensive for what we had  avoid this
this place is bloody awful i went here one time my freshman year at uiuc and ordered their specialty basil chicken with fellow yelper dan t who reviewed this location as well the dish was pricey at 8 dollars a plate  but i was willing to give something different a try instead  when i received my order i got vegetables with ground up chicken bits that were about the size of the beef you would find in ground beef i was immensely disappointed so i went up to the front counter to ask for a refund as this is not the dish i expected it to be instead  in engrish  the manager said to me  you already pay no refund uhm  excuse me if i paid for something and was unsatisfied  shouldnt i receive a fair refund not for this place apparently avoid at all costs and go somewhere else
this food was gross    we got a meatball sub cold  no sauce  salty  minimal meat  meatballs sliced in half that was dry and tasted bad as opposed to the preferable option of tasteless  the chicken ranchero was a mess of mushroom  no lettuce  tomato  ranch or bacon  and  it had sweet peppers on it  in short  it was the wrong sub  ordered online  so i dont know how they got the wrong order  yikes  do not order from here  this place makes subway look like a fivestar restaurant  go there instead  eat fresh   and  we just found out they sent us the wrong sub  instead of rectifying it  the manager hung up on us  stating they didnt have time to deal with it  probably because of all the other wrong orders
this place is gross   first  i got a spicy tempura roll that was chicken instead of tuna  i mean  really chicken  second  the sushi was warm  third  the roll that was made to replace the chicken had an eyelash in the container and it wasnt mine  negative one star    sorry to be so harsh  but its better that you know
wow  these guys are still open  i love cheesesteak sandwiches  and texadelphia has  without a doubt  the worst ive ever had  ive tried three locations  and theyre uniformly dreadful  the meat has little flavor  the bread is too soft and soggy  if you like cheesesteaks  keep going  nothin to see here  folks
if i had read derrell ps review before going  i would have thoughtwell  thats an entertaining review  but could it really have been that bad surely there is some exaggerating going on   and even if it was true  that was back in 2008 the problems must be corrected by nowthey are still in businessif everyone had had bad food and been yelled at  surely the place wouldnt still be around three years later    if i could only go back in time to friday  may 13th and do it all again  trilussa la trattoria would forever remain an unfamiliar restaurant  and precious time and money would not have been wasted  instead  we must be here to let people know that three years later  derrell ps review is unfortunately still accurate    on the bright side  husband made it to the foodpoisoning free zone unscathed  although we held our breathe  also  there was no yelling involved in our otherwise derrell p experience so chef has  made miniscule progress      so  why did we even go to this holeinthewall restaurant on the eve of our 10th wedding anniversary  because we were staying at the carolina inn  it was within walking distance  and it came highly recommended by a friend who described it as their favorite restaurant  which is why we passed by vespa and 411  pushed open the dusty door and actually sat down at an uncomfortable table amidst the the tacky decor and despite the oppressive heat of the small dining room     it is also why we stayed at the uncomfortable table for way too long before seeing a serverand after finding out  the only winebytheglass options were a house red or a house whitetodays being a merlot or pinot grigio at 8 a glass but  i want a glass of chardonnay  is there no way to get one please  i dont care for pinot grigio and it feels too hot in here for merlot  waiter disappears for awhile and returns to make his first apology of the night to say no chardonnay by the glass  but i could take the rest of the bottle with me if i ordered a whole bottle  okay  fine  ill take a bottle of this one then  off he goes  only to return with a different bottle that i had never heard of  had no idea what it would cost or if i would like it  uncle  ill just have a glass of merlot  not playing this game  husband opts for unsweetened tea     by now  weve sitting for at least 20 minutes  husband looks like hes in need of sustenance quickly  so i suggest a caesar salad  especially cause they have an authentic one on the menu that lists anchovies as an ingredient  well  waiter says he doesnt think they have anchovies  but hell check disappears  apology 2  no anchovies   okay  fine well take it anyway before husband passes out     tea and a glass of warm merlot appears  its not boiling  but its  hotter than liquid should be without a teabag in it enough that i fish ice from my water glass  plop it in and try not to think about the 8 price tag     we were very hungry  which is why we tore into the average bread which turned out to be the best part of the meal  and even opened fake butter in a tiny round plastic container and spread it on the bread  its also why we remained sitting despite the caesar salad that arrived with  i kid you not  derrell p was not lyingsomething that resembled mozzarella on top it was mushy  white  tasteless   truly unforgivable  so were the tasteless croutons      oddly enough  i still remained hopeful for our entrees  as i had one coming that was supposed to be a rigatoni with chicken  italian sausage  prosciutto  fresh vegetables in a garlic wine tomato sauce  doesnt that sound great  husband was not only waiting for a tea refill  but was anticipating a capellini dish with shrimp and fresh vegetables in a tomato sauce    we waited and waited  finally our meals arrived  along with a crock of tasteless parmesan  positives i liked the fresh zucchini that was in the dish  the rigatoni was cooked fine  chicken wasnt horrible  despite looking like it had been massacred  what was inexcusable was the hideous mushy  disgusting meatballs that were in it  and the lack of italian sausage or prosciutto  husbands dish was way worse  the fishiesttasting   yet otherwise tasteless pile of mushy pasta with questionable haveiriskedmyhealth shrimp  husband  wanting out  ate it in disbelief that there wasnt even any garlic in it  with the hope we could get this over with and leave  i had to at least question the ingredients or lack of in my dish  waiter explained that the chef must have substituted meatballs for the sausage really but he would ask about the prosciutto      what resulted instead of yelling at us  so i do believe chef has made great progress  was a styrofoam  container of a ziti  prosciutto and onion dish that the chef prepared to prove that there was prosciutto in the kitchen  it was actually not bad  but didnt do us any good as we were staying in a hotel
i only eat here is when im too hammered to walk to shattuck for a real pizza place  the first time i came  i thought i was getting an entire pizza for 4 but i only received 1 slice  making possibly the worst pizza deal ive ever heard of  if you need more than 1 slice to be full aka if you are a guy youll probably go broke one time after coming from kips i ordered 8 slices for myself and it was like 40 fortunately they accept credit cards since who carries around 40 in cash i recommend little caesars for a superior value also  pepes pizza now offers slices  if you eat your pizza at fat slice  you have to stand like livestock along this trough on the side wall i wish little caesars had a similar setup
i went there for lunch on sunday with a friend i have not been there for a few months so i decided to try it again what a disappointment it was  the restaurant was 70 empty so we got a table very quickly ordering is quick and efficient simply by writing down quantities on a sheet of paper we ordered some salad  sushi and maki to start the seaweed salad was atrocious it was very greasy and the dressing on the lettuce at the bottom was diluted then came the sushi and maki the salmon slices on the sushi were extremely thin and the rice part is oversized even by removing half the rice  there was too much to eat comfortably in one bite also to note is that the fish was very soggy and generally did not taste fresh  a better choice for ayce sushi is the yes sushi in downtown kitchener not the yes on kingnorthfield next to sushi 99  the kitchener one is better if im in the area again for a quick bite  i would rather go to pho ben thanh next door
i stopped in here one day for a bubble tea  i asked for the herbal bubble tea with no milk or sweetener  the cashier asked me are you sure  it will be really strong and i said yes  thats the way i drink it  she asked me again  are you sure  i said yes  she finally halfapproved of this and gave me my tea  450  i took one swig and the tea was rotten  i took it back up and told the cashier that it was rotten and she says oh  its probably really strong  i said no  i have had strong tea and rotten tea and this is rotten  she asked me again to be sure and then got the manager to give me a refund  he asked no question and gave me my money back  if you want good tea  go to dado  they will make anything you ask for without asking a million are you sure questions  and their tea is fresh
one star for this place is way too generous  they only take cash  but dont post this in a conspicuous spot   i got stuck in harvard square one day and went in to greenhouse buy a cup of coffee and then asked if i may use their restroom  the waiter on staff looked at me like i was scum and actually shooed me away  flicking his hand like he was swatting a fly  what a meanie  i actually cried
this place is not worth it  i think its the worst restaurant at lobdell  and there are all these indian buffets that are within 10 minutes walking  taste better  and cost an extra dollar    main offenses 1 the naan  the naan at cafe spice is more like a huge chunk of pizza crust  it is not naan    2  samosas suck  its hard to mess up samosas  since the deep fryer hides lots of imperfections but cafe spice does it 3  nothing here is good  im willing to forgive restaurants that might suck at a lot of things  but still make like two things well  ill just order those two things  nothing here is good    a plus side to its general crappniess is that theres rarely a long line
if i were to review the middle east  my biased statements would suggest that the downstairs music venue is an unpleasant place to be  too many people for a small  hot place  not ventilated well enough  sound engineers are obsessed with bass which prevents me from hearing other instruments and lyrics to songs  i am a musician  and i enjoy all music  i saw budos band here a very interesting and eclectic group of musicians and could only hear bass and drums  despite there being about twelve other instruments on the stage  including various horns  i was wearing ear plugs which actually should have allowed me to hear more detail  but everything was unbalanced  i left early  and then i took a shower to wash other peoples sweat off of myself  this is not the middle easts fault  but can someone explain why small music venues seem to prompt people to dance wildly  waving arms and twirling  when there is literally no space for them to do so  im a hippie too  people  but i seem to have a greater awareness of the concept of personal space than some others
this is the worst subway ive ever been to  its attached to a convenience store on the corner of beacon and mass ave  everytime i go in there the same guy is working  and he is the only guy i ever see  he isnt very nice and he always skimps on all the meat  cheese  and all the other toppings  he also doesnt offer any of the deals on different days that most subways do  skip it unless you are starving and cant find anywhere else
oh my this place blows went in with a bunch of guys to celebrate a friends birthday last friday the atmosphere of the place is great  however  when it came time to order a drink  this is how the conversation went  me hey man can i get a long island ice tea bartender sorry man we cant make a long island me why not bartender we dont have a liquor license to mix more than 3 alcohols together me wtf  are you serious bartender yeah but heres a list of our cocktails  i have never heard of a bar not having a liquor license to mix more than 3 kinds of alcohol together i was flabbergasted and i didnt know how to respond i ended up ordering one of their disgusting cocktails it was just gin with water and lime for 11 do not go here
the food was not tasty
we didnt give this a chance why we went there because my wife wanted a big salad nothing on the menu looked appealing  ie like a salmon salad or crab salad it was all basic stuff  like beets  nothing complex  and the prices were around 10 bucks i looked at the entrees and noticed that sides  such as potatoes and vegetables  were for sale in other words  if i ordered an entree  there would be no complimentary side dishes as 95 percent of the restaurants in the world have the waitress was nice and the host greeted us at the door further  there was no one in the place hardly guess we werent the only one that felt it was outlandish they had better adjust that menu im sure that overhead is high  we got up and left and went to maxs opera cafe at stanford sc much better menu  a lot more for the money then again  that wouldnt be hard to do
i have never been to pizza man  but i wish they would stop putting menus on the doorknobs in my neighborhood its both wasteful and poses a security risk theres been a wave of burglaries here  and these menus only help criminals determine which houses are unoccupied please stop
unfortunately i brought a few friends here since i have had such amazing food and service in the past i am downgrading matsuri for the crappy service we received i had to get up twice  and my date had to get up once to get water  the check  attention  what have you as the servers entered and exited the dining room  the stare of death would not cause them to look in our direction as we stared at our empty water glasses and mess of plates after we finished dining  it might have been an hour before we finally were able to leave i am so bummed about this  you hate to proudly bring friends to a restaurant that can suck so bad the food was still good  but who can taste it when you are constantly trying to get your servers attnetion i was going to give 2 stars  but changed my mind because i was so embarrassed to bring friends here  i love matsuri not 5 stars because it is kind of casual however the sushi is amazing to me  and the service amazing  and just a great fun place to go lunch or dinner  i prefer to sit at the sushi bar and ask the chef to give me what hes got try the shiso hot it is spicy tuna served in a new way so good  the sashimi salad is great too  which i had with my best asian girlfiriend when we sat at a table so good the people are great  they beat a drum when you walk in  its just great fun and the people are wonderful  a great fun place to go  according to some  the sushi portions are small  but for me it is perfect you know i have a small stomach or something  closed on sunday  enjoy namaste tonya mtbchickcomtonyahtml
if i were to score this place off of the food id give it at least 35 stars the shabu shabu was simple and came with all the veggies  udon  goodies  etc the meat seemed fresh very very thin the ponzu sauce was good  but a tad salty nothing compared to the ponzu from shabu shabu house  they had the typical minced daikon  garlic  and green onion sides  which i kinda abused hehe the ponzu and rice was unlimited yayyy  but the waitress kept giving us half bowls of rice instead of full ones i ended up eating 4 bowls i swear im not a fatass if i were to stop here  youd think that my experience here wasnt all that bad actually pretty good for a sit down food place in the good ol usc neighborhood but it was the service that really dragged the rating down we were initially the only people there  so we got pretty good and efficient service for the first 30 min or so once more people came  our waitress became much much slower and it seemed like the other waiters were just lounging around while she did most of the work what really pissed me off was when we went to pay for our meal it took her forever to bring the check and when my friend and i requested to split the bill exactly in half with our cards  she messed up and double charged us both then it took her at least 30 minutes to learn how to void the transaction during that time  we missed our ride home  i was almost late to my meeting  and we realized that we had to walk home in the cold no bueno for two tiny asian girls who arent used to the cold finally  they voided it but they werent sure whether itll go through so the manager gave us his phone number to call just in case it doesnt gee thanks  after we signed all the stuff  we headed out  very grumpy the waitress chased us down the street and told us that she made us sign the wrong receipts and accidentally charged some other tables credit card instead so then we repeated the whole process wow can i say incompetent  i understand that she may be new and all but seriously you dont mess up like that twice in a row not to mention  they werent really apologetic at all when it happened with that being said  i rather go to somewhere less convenient for shabu shabu rather than put myself through another one of these experiences
i rather eat straight up white rice and soy sauce than eat here ive been here many a times  and each time continues to disappoint not only is the food bad  but the service is also atrocious the chicken bowl was awful and took close to 45 minutes to come out the people working there werent even apologetic and the entire time they were fooling around and being super slow also  after seeing the people in the back work without gloves and lick their fingers  then proceed to touch the food i have lost my appetite every time i remind myself how much i hate this place  but i only go for its damn convenience if you werent located directly under my apt  i would give you 0 stars but then again the time it takes for my food to come out is equivalent to the time it takes for me to walk somewhere better and get food thus  i give this place 05 stars for bad sushi  bad soup saw the server in the back try it and say that it tastes really weird and bad but then proceed to serve it  bad chicken bowl  bad potstickers tastes funky  bad everything  bad service  bad manaagement   and now im just ranting but thats just how bad it is
 as an edit after receiving a rude reply from the owner  questioning whether or not i had buyers remorse after eating fried foods or whether or not i understand the difference between frying in canola oil and lardanimal fat ive decided to deduct a star or even 2 i wish i could give this 0 stars never in my life have i had a restaurant owner attack me for giving my honest opinion on the food i am offended and the response came off as super rude  original post i randomly get these tempura cravings and the one day that i decide to walk over to the other side of campus  i see the tempura truck sitting there  waiting for me to order from it super excited  i got the shrimp tempura hoping to get some nice  lightly battered  crispy  juicy pieces of shrimp  but no instead  this truck basically fried the living souls out of those poor shrimps the batter was so heavy  the fry so greasy  and the sauce was so typical overall i felt like an obese kid paving my way to cardiovascular disease while eating the tempura yah the shrimp was juicey as an edit  apparently the owner attacks this claim saying that if the shrimps were juicy  how were they overcooked well now let me explain  the shrimps were juicy  but the batter and fry around it was uneven and overcooked the edges were dark brown and tasted burnt  yah the portions were big  but noo i dont want to feel like my heart is about to stop every time i take a bite  way too oily  way too heavy  way too fried   ugh time to go work out now i feel gross  so there you go  tempura truck maybe its time for you to crack open some business books next time you decide to respond to an angry customer
wow  this place really sucks its cheap but theres a reason why even with the free quesedilla w purchase offer when you check in  it wont bring me back here most dissatisfying meal ever  carne asada fajita burrito still has slimy beansnot much fajita going on meat tastes a month old gross  also  guy at drive through isnt so smart gave him 10xx for a 5xx bill he didnt give me my change had to ask for it shady or what trying to jip me 5   foods no good people arent friendly and obviously not smart just trying to steal my money with disgusting food and pretending to forget my change   i see how it is
this place is overrated   the food is so so not as great as everyone says it is its literally a fat hot dog with typical ingredients piled on top its lacking sauce between the hot dog vs the sausage  the sausage is definitely better  tried the following   so calithis was the best item during my visit  the spring mix and aioli sauce  fried crunchy stuff added a nice flavor and crunch to the bite  holy aioli burgerit was soft normal burger  nothing special adding relish  onions from the condiment bar helped  abe froman sausage w onions and peppersno sauce dry dry dry   the chachion special that day on the blk chalkboard it came w pastrami and onionssoso  the food here is literally what it is ive had better hot dogs and sausages elsewhere costco sausage dog tastes just as good  if not better   also  the establishment is not groupon friendly  i came here with a friend we both had groupons the guy taking our separate orders gave us an attitude over it since he said it was one per table this place is pay at the counter and find a seat wherever type joint its not a sit in  order while youre at the table  and they bring your food type of place  so that rule shouldnt even apply plus  the groupon clearly states you can buy one as a gift i hate places that make up their own rules shady  not coming back not a good deal even with the groupon doesnt taste good enough for me to come back
if you like slow service and retarded workers  come here  just came back from here  and i have to say that this was the worst experience i have ever had from wing stop  this location is horrible   it took them over 20 minutes to serve me my order to go what did i order  french fries  i really couldnt believe why it was taking so long to dish out a simple side order such as french fries  im gonna have to say that im officially going to protest this location  thumbs down wing stop on fig
i second elaine ts review  i went here a few weeks ago and drove around the plaza for 10 minutes  finally concluding that they must have closed down  what a disappointment
i want to make it really really clear  i am not looking for sit down  napkin on the lap service i know what heroes is  i go to the one in fullerton all the time and it was a meeting place for old friends  when you have 2 guys come in during the day time on an empty day and cant even get a menu or order a beer from an empty bar with two bartenders thats badon a friday night where the bartender blows off your order and pours himself a beer and gives you the cold shoulder  or when you sit down after waiting forever and the waitress stands you up and says these people have a bigger group after they just walked inyeah that is insulting   i know what a cheers getdrunk and eat place is in fact i was at cheers in boston where i got drunk and atethe fullerton heroes is always packed at night and yet they always manage to get you a table and beer quickly why is it that an empty place cant even place a beer order at a bar with two bartenders  ok you want a simple breakdown  ill give you a simple breakdown and then ill throw suggestions in there    peanuts go on ground yay big portions of mediocre food beer variety through dirty hoses servicethat will get to you eventually the letter h in the beginning of the name  yes you get to eat peanuts and then throw them on the ground yay that is really entertaining for the first 5 minutes unfortunately to get to that point where you can enjoy eating peanuts and throwing shells on the ground you need to be seated and offered said peanuts that may take you 15 minutes when the place is emptygod help you if its full  which baffles me how it can be  yes they have burgers yes they are huge omg so many frikin fries but that meal took so long that by the time they killed the cow and ground up the meat  got done with their side conversation about shoes or whatever  updated the facebook status  talked about their weekend  had a beer break  etc hence the reason why it took them over 12 an hour to make a burger  there also must be a maze between the bar and the kitchen because those poor girls get lost so by the time it gets to you  youre so hungry that burger is gonna taste awesome dont be fooled  their burgers are mediocre at best  if you are a starving student or a teenager and you are comparing mcdonalds  jack in the box  carls or heroes  well then yes heroes has the better burger congrats you beat the dollar menui will say it  heroes burgers taste better than mass produced meat cleaned with ammonia to prevent e coli outbreakshey do you know who else has big burgers the press and the back abbeyand their burgers a delicious actually i order something new each time i visit those places and i havent had a bad thing yet  yes they have beer yes they have microbrew like stone arrogant bastard  yay gargoyle  middle finger  hops and an oak barrel  do you know who else has varieties of beer every other place on that strip do they have as many probably not  but seriously  what do most people drink blue moon arrogant bastard a  chimay to feel fancy the press has a good beer selection if youre like me and you love beer  the back abbey has so many trappist beers on tap that you wouldnt know what to dobe warned though  both the back abbey and the press get packed  but just wait a minute or two and the bartender will get to you  they will get you a beer  they will make time for you ask yourself this question what is the point of going to a beer place if i cant get a beer  and if i do get a beer its served through dirty hoses that throw off the beer flavor for you youngins who just turned 21 and trying to get your drink onif you dont like beer and just like to pee a lot and get tipsy  drink corona or the lightlite beers if you likelove beer then dont drink tainted beer if you dont have to  yes they have service crappy crappy is a type of service just like telling a personal trainer that round is a shape  i want to give you my money  i want to tip you wellwhy do you prevent me from doing this so willingly pay in cash  rumor has it that if you pay by card you might find that they tip themselves generously   i am of the mindset if i see dog crap on the ground  i see you walk to it and i dont warn you  then its on me for not warning you and you messing up your shoes with dog crap here  this is me saying there is nasty on the ground  dont step in it   please please please visit the back abbey  the press  viva madrid  any place but heroes  legendsdo yourself a favor visit heroes in fullerton they have great beer selection  great service  clean keg hoses  good food  quick service and great atmosphere
if you really enjoy faux irish pubs staffed with rude bartenders and annoying clientele that look like your uncle put up tons of bs euro schwag in his garage to attract 21 year olds then welcome home  the beer pong tables are warm  the roofiecoladas ready and plenty of screeching trixies to make any popped collar male salivate  i love asking what do you have on tap and being met with everything you see here  dont work too hard  you might herniate a disk    if youre over 23 and have self respect you shouldnt be drinking here
so a few friends of and i wanted to hit a spot that had a huge portion of nachos that served beer we ended up at heroes i havent been to heroes in a couple of years and the last time i was here i remember the food and alcohol selection to be good  not to mention good for groups i was wrong   the place is designed to look like a sports bar and they hand you free packages of peanuts when youre done husking a peanut you can just toss the spent shell on the ground all the sports games are beamed from their tvs against the bar wall  the service was mediocre at best we waited a long time to put our orders in  waited a long time for our drinks  and waited even longer for our bill   the food if you can call it that was probably the worst ive had in a few months  anywhere the nachos were the only saving grace and they werent even that tasty stick with the half order  do not get the full order i ordered a chicken sandwich with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes i couldnt even get halfway through my sandwich before i had to put it down the fries were so salty to the point of being almost inedible i dont even want to get into what happened the next morning after eating here my friends ordered a french dip and a buffalo burger both of them were very disappointed with their meal   i dont know what happened to this place a few years ago the food was pretty good and the service was great   for the same price and a wider selection of beers  i strongly recommend other places to eatdrink such as the back abbey or eureka burger
probably the worst sushi experience ive ever had but then again  you cant expect much when going to an allyoucaneat restaurant in kw   everything is prepared really fast with little regard to presentation or quality the spicy salmon turned out to be salmon rolls with hot sauce drizzled on top  the cooked food section is ok  the tempura is acceptable at least you get allyoucaneat ice cream you cant go wrong with ice cream  im always amazed by the enthusiastic responses i get towards yes i guess people here dont know good sushi
beware  the parking lot for this business now has a person on the lot hiding in a car who boots your car as soon as you leave the property  even if you are only going off the property for 2 minutes after having lunch  i have gone to this business for years but will not ever again  this deceptive practice and holding you up for 75 is terrible
i am so disappointed to find out that they had changed hands to einstein bros bagels  a few weeks back i thought they are going through a remodeling as the noahs bagels sign and trimmings were removed inside the store  today when i went there the sign had changed to an ugly yellow and black logo  my first impression was  what an unappealing logo  remodeling was completely done inside the store  however  they no longer offer the same choices of bagels  the peppercorn potato bagels have changed to potato bagels  no peppercorn  cranberry orange bagels which they used to have during thanksgiving and christmas seasons have no orange  just cranberry bagels  i then ordered my favorite usual which was good grain bagels  when i went to check out  i found that not only did they change management  they also raised the price  half a dozen costs 529  however  the worst thing was that when i was about the enjoy my good grain bagel  it was hard as stone  i even had a hard time to tear it apart  also  the good grain bagel has a sweetness to its taste  i had the first bite and then the 2nd  the bagel was too hard to devour  i then brought all the bagels back to the cashier and asked them if the bagel was from yesterday  all the cashiers know me because i have been buying bagels from them throughout the week  always half a dozen  always good grain  peppercorn potato and blueberries  i told them that the bagels did not taste fresh as it was hard as stone  i told them i know what a fresh bagel is different from a dayold bagel as i bought them throughout the week  the staff said it just came out about an hour ago and they always gave away bagels that was unsold by the end of the day  i told them to try it out as the bagel was too hard to devour  also  i asked them why the bagel tastes sweet now  they said they had added corn crumbs and honey wheat to the bagels i am totally disappointed with the new recipe  luckily  the cashier was willing to give me a full refund  i dont know anything about einstein bros bagels but this new management sucks  it is such a big disappointment that my favorite bagels are all gone and recipes changed  i would rather go to panera even though their bagels are more expensive  at least they would not serve me hardasstone bagels
because im from la  i thought pho might be a safe choice for having asian food here at austin it turned out i was wrong i didnt try other dishes here  but their pho was absolutely the worst that i have ever had the soup was so salty  the beef was also scarce  the rice noodle was just overbroiled
the only reason for me to step in was its only several blocks away from my school their pho 1 is mediocre with only a few pieces of meat rare beef was okay  welldone beef was like plastic meat ball was like rubber ball chopped into three pieces even in pasadena  its been overpriced 10 for a mediumsized pho come on  this is sgv you can easily find much better pho with much more meat under 6 or 7 id rather drive to alhambra or san gabriel next time
very expensive  taste is not that good  we were really disappointed moreover serving size is small  not many veg options i surely will not go here again
poor service  worse coffee  we ordered 2 cappuccinos they were made with preground espresso taken out of an unsealed plastic bin   the proportions were way off and i could not even finish it  they claim to to roast their own beans which makes me wonder why they dont put the effort into preparing the coffee properly  there is no excuse for serving espresso made with preground beans  if you dont want to buy a decent grinder for espresso just dont serve it  i didnt have the drip coffee but i witnessed the cashier pouring two old pots together
overpriced cupcakes and long lines the quality is ok but nothing so extraordinary to stand in line for half an hour i wish they would put  less frosting on them   it really overpowers the taste of the cake used
blech the dark chocolate frosting was way too sugary  and the cake was dry and crumbly and lacked much in the way of chocolate flavor also  you have to order at the counter and wait to be called wtf  even if all youre having is a cupcake on a plate they even waste an order slip on single items their cupcakes cost 350 tax not included  so i paid more than karas would have cost me for an inferior product  the counter people seemed very friendly  but the cupcake was lackluster enough that i wont be back
if i remember correctly  the way you make kirks fries is as following  1 open your bag of frozen fries 2 dunk them in oil 3 serve  im waiting for my heart attack  note theyre not all too welcoming towards high schoolers anymore
straight off  know this when you see my rating  hair in my crossaint  how nasty is that maybe theyre trying to show its actually handmade i stared at the hair and said  okay  im not eating another bite  their buffarello mozzerella salads are good and hairless but it does seem a little pricey 7 when compared to the regular salads 5 the paninis are not very filling  though  heres a tip as if you can switch your tart what is that one that looks like a brain with one of the mini chocolate squares to the left of the register now  those are goooood
i probably had one of my worst restaurant experience here  i just graduated from college so a couple of my friends and i went there to have dinner some of my friends wanted to order a beer and they ended up showing up him their passport since all of us were international students it was obviously an international passport he looked at it and was like pennsylvania law states that it has to be an us issued id basically non americans are not allowed to drink in pennsylvania although they have identification clearly proving that they are over 21  since this was now a matter of principle  i pulled out my windows phone 7  went to the pennsylvania state law website and proved it to him that international passports were indeed valid acceptable ids   we would have walked out if it werent for the fact that we had already ordered our food and places and it was getting late he was rude to us for the rest of the night and it was a pretty bad experience for the seven of us who went there to celebrate graduating  never ever going back there
having moved back to nyc from california  i definitely miss the huge  megachain supermarkets and their selections and prices  unfortunately for me  morton williams is the closest market to my building  unfortunately because   the prices are beyond ridiculous for both fresh fruitveggies and nonperishables  the prices are comparable to whole foods though theyre not organic  if not more for certain items 189 for a can of evaporated milk is nuts  the majority of the cashiers are miserable  i didnt think it was possible to express so much misery in a 2 minute 99 nonverbal transaction  its like each customer they ring up is their mortal enemy  and they get ruder by the hour the ones who work at 3am are way worse than those working at 3pm  they have an okay selection of things  but not everything that you might need their over the counter medicine  health and beauty products are confined to a tiny section  and of course  are like 15 times what youd pay at duane reade  there are only 2 positives   its 24 hours  its clean  well lit and ventilated nice that they blast the ac during hot days
looking at the menu  i was tempted to try a salad rather than pizza but my friend recommended i try their pizza because they believed it was good   i had the margarita and was very disappointed  the crust was burnt and the sauce was thin and runny it did not have much cheese if i were to return to this restaurant i would surely not go for the pizza expensive for the unsatisfactory quality and size
only good if you are really drunk trust me  i know from experience
update after four separate dinner occasions at luna  i will not go back  ive had horrendous customer service each time and the food was just okay  a friend and i came here for a nice dinner on a saturday night  they werent busy at all  we planned to order a bottle of wine and asked the server who clearly had no service experience what she recommended after waiting a good 1015 minutes for a wine menu  she saidand i quotei dont know  im not really a wine drinker  im more of a beer drinker and walked away  seriously  this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant and you cant even recommend something  anything  this was absolutely ridiculous  whatever  it gets better  we finally order a bottle at random and she comes back with it about 15 minutes later again  theyre not busy at all  she gets to our table with it  clearly tries to remember what shes been told to do presentationwise  and then saysohi dont know how to open this  and goes to get another server  then sits our white wine on the table  we request a bucket to keep it cool  which should be a given  and she looks clearly annoyedconfused  anyway  we both ordered the risotto  which was decent  but not fantastic at all  i think our bill was 8090 for two  which is fine if the food and experience are great  but in this case  i felt like i totally got ripped off  i have a couple of other fantastic customer service stories about previous experiences here  so its clear to me that they cant quite get it together  luna  go to bacaro and take notes
tried the newest pizza joint in latham last night had big expectations given the decor and the unique combinations offered on the menu heres the rundown  extralarge meatlovers pizza  a ton of meat  not a lot of flavor small pepperoni pizza  not much better than a frozen pizza 10 bbq wings  tender  juicy and good flavor didnt come with bleu cheese dressing or carrotscelery 1 star large eggplant parm sub  a lot of eggplant and not a lot of cheese or sauce small antipasto salad  fresh veggies  green leaf lettuce  meat and provolone rollups no extras marinated peppersartichokesolives and no dressing 2 stars  so not a redo for me luckily there are 9 other pizza places within a 1 mile radius to choose from good luck crispy basil
i never see soap in their bathrooms so  im not sure how the staff are washing their handsenough said   oh yea that staff is nice and the service is good its always crowded seat wise but yeamethinks not
i work around the corner and have had take out lunch here several times  the food is always mediocre at bestbut the last time i ordered there was a hair in the dough of my steamed dumpling  so gross  im not going back
if it were not for brown and their students insatiable appetite for margaritas and lousy mexican food this place would have shut its doors years ago stay away
rynos is on telegraph  close to channing its not very good the yogurt was melting fast and their strawberries were rotting sighi guess the decor was ok given i went in 2008 maybe its gotten better
this pinkberry deserves 0 stars for our recent encounter  dont get me wrong  pinkberry is good stuff  but this location is beyond pathetic  sorry employees  but you guys really need to get it together  we ordered a smoothie  it was completely empty in the joint and they acted like they had never made a smoothie before  first of all  we had to wait 5 or so minutes for another employee to run to the back and get milk because they had none  while waiting  the employee was asking us questions like  would you like milk or ice mixed into your smoothie  what  our answer put whatever you normally do to make a smoothie  thanks  so the employee nervously fills a dinky 12 oz smoothie cup with oodles of strawberries  almonds and chocolate our choice of ingredients for the smoothie and then finally the milk arrivesthe guy anxiously opens the milk on its way down to the table and blends the strawberries  chocolate and almonds and milk in a blender  were thinking  ok then he asks us  is this thick enough for you   mind you  why ask the question  it looked like diluted pepto bismol   we say  arent you going to add some yogurt   my husband looks to me and says  are we not in a freakin yogurt shop  haha    then the guy quickly adds a teeny bit of yogurt blends it for 2 seconds and keeps his head down and serves it to us  come on  start over dude  we had a bad feeling from the start that the disorganization and cluelessness of the workers took all confidence that this smoothie would have anything on a red mango smoothie  not to our surprise  the pinkberry smoothie was horrendous and we dumped it after a few sips  we ended up going out of our way to jamba juice    if we werent late for our event  we would have complained  it was comical to say the leastwe would have demanded a refund 450 worth of nasty frothy pink milk  wheres the yogurt 1 tiny squirt of yogurt isnt going to change the texture of this thing or whatever it waspathetic guys
sushi rock does not rock i went for dinner and lunch and both times  it was overpriced for the portion and the quality i love salmon so i got their sunrise roll and their salmon avocado roll i barely finished half of what i ordered because it was just unappetizing their salmon was sort of tasteless and i was really looking for that salmony flavor   isnt anyone else outraged that they charge 099 for miso soup when i went to sushi places this summer soup and salad were usually given for free actually  i cant recall a sushi place that ever charged for miso soup   one star for their cheeseballs
i live off of liberty ave and everyone kept telling me i needed to try this place  so after 4 months i did  when my wife and i walked in i thought  this place doesnt look too bad  actually kinda cool  wrong  after being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table  our food took about 45 minutes  which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast  but i though  everyone thinks this place is great  i guess i can wait for perfection   the food gets to our table  it looks good  it looks like breakfast  but it is cold  well mine was cold  so im sitting at the table  empty coffee  cold breakfast and quite pissed off  because of the situation and im hungry  finally after about 1012 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is  i tell her my food is cold  and im fine and dont need another plate  we had already been there over an hour  we had placed to go  ya know  when the waitress brings the bill over she doesnt just tell me she took my food off  she says  i figured i would take the food off even though you didnt ask really  should i have to  wifes food was hot  but she thought it to be just average breakfast  i never want to go back  but i will  because i always give places another shot  terribly slow service server was very nice though  probably home from college  and food took forever  i doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis  because this place wouldnt be so packed and highly regarded
ok maybe  just maybe the kitchen staff at royal bengal was having an offday  the day i decided to go we wanted to have a goodbye dinner for our friend who was leaving to go visit home in bombay and someone in our party recommended this restaurant im not exactly sure what some of the other people ordered  but two of my girl friends and i decided to split the lamb masala and the aloo gobhi the lamb masala was decent  but something was just wrong with the aloo gobhi at first  i thought it was just me and that i didnt know the difference between good and bad indian food but everyone else at the table tasted it out of our party of nine  seven were born and raised in india  and dubbed it inedible we ended up sending two dishes back to the kitchen because they were just plain nasty the only positive thing about that night was the yogurt lassi that helped me wash everything else down
still sucks i want my stars back
so i came into this place a couple weeks ago because some friends wanted to grab breakfast on a sunday i must say i was completely blown away i loved the 50s diner feel and the friendlybut thats about it the staff was really busy so i didnt mind the wait so much and i arrived before my party of four so i expected to wait a hot minute when the rest of my party arrived however we waited and waitedand waited after finally getting our orders taken we played the waiting game again i didnt mind waiting so much as that our drinks were never refilled the waitress pretty much ignored our table until our food was just about to come out by this time i was starving so seeing the food on the tucked way food bar in the back i became elated untilthe waitress cleaning the bar off with a bar towel proceeds to use the same bar towel to wipe of my plate i guess it was still wet from washing and set the food on the plate i immediately told the waitress my friends and i were leaving and why she repliesoh needless to say i will never come back or recommend this place
probably by far the worst place ive ever eaten this year or make it the past 3 years the ramen so boring the meal was so entertainingly boring  i found myself taking out my iphone and rechecking my facebook over 40 times  even though i knew for certain there were no new notifications i also had to continuously squirt inappropriately copious amounts of teriyaki and sesame sauce into the bowl on several repeated attempts to liven it up i also tried on several attempts to enjoy some of the wall decorations inside the restaurant which i later on decided that the faded photo of the gyoza on the right side of their menu was the most exciting thing to gaze at between taking forced bites of my ramen i did gaze up at the ceiling a few times and saw that red round thing actually  i just remembered  the most exciting part of the meal occurred as one worker went around to each window and raised the sun blinds up  so that more light could stream into the restaurant that was neat i thought to myself  how could anyone back there in the kitchen not be ashamed of what is coming out do they even know do they   but man i got to give it up to the guy working the counter  5 stars for him such a happy guy i dont know how he does it i dont know   bless your blessed souls you brave usc trojans who are forced to eat here by proximity  by the way  i ate the entire bowl even drank all the broth down to the last drop thats how you do it immedately walked out the door throwing up 2 peace signs toward the sky
very unfriendly restaurant  went in and refused to seat us because i had a baby with me  wtf when asked why they said because they served hot tea  whateversakura express has  way better sushi than your little sewer hole
im not sure if this place deserves one stari went with my husband tonight to get some dinner  we ordered two specialty rolls  chirashi  and tamago sushi  the rolls were tasteless  the fish was tasteless tuna was especially fishy in a bad way  and the portion sizes were very small the tamago was not what we expected at all  for the amount of money we spenti couldve gotten much better at sakura express definitely not worthy of a return visit
i have not been impressed with this place even though i tried to give them a few chances  i dined in the restaurant once and the place was so cramped that the next table was only a few inches from mine  i could hear the conversation of the people that were two tables away  their menu said that my combo came with a salad but they never brought one to me claiming their menu was misprinted  i felt since they advertised it they should of comped the salad or mentioned it before i ordered  the second time we went there i ordered an adana wrap to go and it was so small for something that was 8  there one tiny piece of meat in the wrap  the third time i ordered delivery from there and and they overcharged me by more than five dollars  i didnt realize because i did not have the menu with the prices until i looked at the one stapled to our food  i was not happy about that
blakes is full of ampted 1924 yearold berkeley students getting tanked in order to prep for banging one of the many slutty rotten eggs that hang there luckily  some ok bands are seen into the basement from time to time but as the night progresses  the slime from the main floor and upstairs inevitably oozes not only into the basement but out onto telegraph ave here  overtestosteroned boys cranky from not scoring poon start fights with eachother  barf  and eventually drive home drunk awesome
cheap cheap cheap with the toppings ive been here once  right when it opened they barely filled the cup with yogurt  and the middle was hollow thanks for the single teaspoon sprinkling of granola  and carefully laid out strawberries wtf
hohoho  its almost indulgently fun to write reviews about restaurants like this  almost as fun as spotting the typos on the menu  nothing was good about this place  not one thing  i got the spicy beef  with a side of brown rice that evidently i have to pay extra for  thanks for letting me know after the fact  as i could have predicted  the bowl was 70 onion and pepper  and the beef was like paper  no seriously  havent you ever tried to eat a tiny piece of paper  thats what the beef was like  chewy and flavorless  not to mention indigestible  the omnipotent clovebasil flavor was overwhelming  and the only source of spiciness was the serrano peppers  i could have just brought my own serranos  what a cheap way to create heat  however  it certainly wasnt cheap economically  considering i had to add a gratuity tip because i was with a large group of people  nothing irks me more than being forced to tip services that do an abysmal job    lastly  a random thought  on one wall they have a certificate hanging up that thanks berkeley thai house for a donation to the child abuse foundation  um  shouldnt that organization be called the antichild abuse foundation  yikes
multidimensional failure  i wish i could review the actual cupcakes but am instead forced to review why i couldnt have there cupcakes  it was after the super bowl and i wanted to surpise my girlfriend with a cupcake as she was studying for a final the next day someone at the watching party mentioned giving trophy a shot as i was thinking of just heading over to cupcake royale as i was already in capitol hill i whip out my phone and hop on there website to check how late they are open on sundays and the site clearly states 9pm so i figure i am good to go  upon arriving at the university village i cant find the place and it is getting close to 9pm  i double check the website on my phone for a hint of what part of the massive complex they are located but have no luck eventually i google trophy cupcake university village and find a couple articles about the opening of the store which mentioned something about a frog fountain and a play ground which at least gives me something to look for i park and go check a map and i see fountain icons and what i can only figure is a playground icon on the map so i walk in that direction only to find a pitch black store  so not only did their website lie to me you cant even see the store from the road so im not sure how the hell they expect you to find it  upon getting home and checking the yelp page i see that yelp has them closing at 6pm on sundays and when i go to there website using my own computer it also says 6pm now i think i am going to crazy so i double check with my phone and it still says 9pm  flash is evil for the love of god stop using flash  on my phone when i click on locations i am directed to the following page which only loads the text and not the flash on my cell phone httpwwwtrophycupcakescominfohtm  if you view source on that page youll see where it says 9pm is the close on sundays which is exactly what i saw i wouldnt have cared if they closed at 6pm on sunday if there webpage had just told me that and i hadnt wasted my time trying to hunt the place down
first  they dont take reservations so we get there at 545pm  and there is a 2 hr wait  and the 2 very small bars that they  do have are full but it is first come first serve so we take our chance at the bar   we order a drink and strategically stand behind a couple that were finishing their dinner at the bar  while they were finishing another couple had just walked into the bar area and were obviously big money and went straight to the bartenders to talk to them  the couple standing in front of us were about to leave and looked right at us and offered us their seats  we sit down  and the bartender walks over to us and tells us sorry  but these seats have been promised to this couple  the one that had just walked in   so you dont take reservations  but you promise bar seats to people   we could not believe it and decided to walk right out thank goodness hemenways  is right down the street because it had a much better bar area and was not filled with stuck up people as in al fornos
take it for what it is  i suppose  cuatros has a big patio  its great for groups  you can watch all the soccer you want there  the food is terrible  and i am consistently disappointed with the service  last time i went  we waited two seconds to get our table  and about an hour and fifteen minutes for the waitress to take our order  i understand that we were a big group  but if you want to provide service to big groups  hire a bigger wait staff  service that slow really takes away from the dining experience  its hard to enjoy your food when youre angry about the slow service    what upsets me most is the included gratuity  if youre going to hire an insufficient wait staff for your giant restaurant  its really unfair to demand a tip like that  we were a large group  and our check was not split up i think waiters and waitresses who cantdont do this are dumb and lazy  evidently we shorted the waitress about 12 on a few hundred dollar tab  which always seems to happen even if everyone swears that they paid in full  she came out and told us that we shorted her  take the hit  you were a terrible waitress  you dont deserve a tip that high  so when we accidentally come up short  have some pride and class  and go home with 12 dollars less that night  instead of whining to the table about it  at least one of their waitresses is a whiny baby who is in over her head in the restaurant business  i always groan when people want to go to dinner here with a group  next time  i wont be ordering food  you brought it on yourself  cuatros
this place is overpriced for subpar food  the waitstaff is too stoned to take less than a half hour on any order  people rave about the queso here  but i dont know why  its too thick and salty  and the chips dont help  i havent had pancakes here  and i hear theyre worth the trip  but nothing gets me excited to eat here  i say can it and find a taco stand on the street
bunch of buttholes who work hereincluding the manager who probably isnt even certified to manage anything  basically  a couple months ago i ordered a pizza via phone  employee tells me that service is backed up and that i would have to wait at least an hourokay fine with me except i never received my pizza after an hour and 15 minutes of patiently waiting  i call back and the employee informs me that they have no record whatsoever of my order i demand to speak to manager  and all she does apologizes rudely might i add and hangs up and thats it not even an offer to makeup  etc will never  ever order here again
this place is dirty  just  bleh  out of all the places on the drag  this place is one of the nastiest  i dont know why all my friends like going to this place  i tried the pad thai yeah  yeah  i know  stereotypical customer getting pad thai  but it was nasty  i feel like i would be able to make better pad thai on my own and im a terrible  terrible cook  and then the customer service  ack  that was terrible  i understand that they can get busy and all but this was just down right terrible  if i return to madam mams it will not be my choice
yeah madam mams is in close vicinity to college students attending ut  yeah its thai food on the drag yeahhhthats about it for me  walking inside  the place smells horrendous  like bathrooms no joke and looks unclean  prices are high and portions are tiny  the food itself is not pleasing at allvery americanized and not fresh  the pad thai had sauce that lookedtasted like ketchup  the mangosticky rice dessert is sour  the consistency of the rice was just not right  and there was barely any coconut milk on it  i have ate there numerous times unfortunatelyi had no choice due to friends pick  and i swear i had tummy aches after each visit for the rest of the day    if you want thai food  go down the drag to thai kitchen
well  what can i say about food at this place   plain  small  expensive just like all the chinese food in the area  this place is no exception the food i got here was exactly what i kinda expected from places this close to campus  maybe im bitching because ive been spoiled in houston  where you can still get a giant plate of lunch special in chinatown for 4 bucks  or have two giant meals with enough leftovers for four more for 305 tip oh well  these college kids seems to be content with this but to me the standards are set long ago and in a land far far 160 miles away   the chinese food here just doesnt hold up maybe one day some dashing young houstonian with a kind heart and an entrepreneur sense will liberate your schooltormented souls with cheap and delicious food and not be tempted to overcharge your butt for profit until that day  keep shelling out 8 or more for a plate and think youre getting a great deal here id rather save my chinese appetite and my money for gas to houston better quality  quantity  and pricing
hello can you bus the tables hello we came to double daves on a saturday night  one other couple just finished up and was leaving we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 1520 minutes waiting on some out of town family to arrive most of the tables were filled with leftover food and dirty dishes it was gross the restaurant was not busy at all  so its not as if the staff was overwhelmed or anything we had to find a table off in a darkened corner because of this blech  sadly  we did eat there  though not very much because we had lost our appetites and the food is not that great   and when we left absolutely none of the tables had been cleared another family that was arriving was in the same boat they sat right next to us because there was no where else to sit wth really  what reason do i have to return
this is not chinese food  a friend and i came here one time  honestly  because we heard it was bad and we wanted to see for ourselves just how bad bad was  boy ill tell ya  bad is about as bad as it gets the foodisjust plain wrong  like above  it is not chinese food  and why anyone would call it chinese food is completely beyond me  not to mention  i had to pay ten dollars for a plate ofdisgustingness  angry does not even describe how i was feeling  i almost didnt pay for my meal and i certainly did not tip  because that was just a completely waste of my time and money
went back for lunch again was in the area again for work and was asked if we were there for breakfast or lunch  being that it was 1100 am i said wed take both menus and take a look    by the time we were all ready to order off the breakfast menu we had to wait a bit for another diner to meet us  our waitress told us that we were no longer allowed to order off the breakfast menu  when i told her we were given a menu and a choice when we walked in  she said that was then  well now    so on two seperate occasions ive tried to order breakfast  and twice ive been denied  no leniency either time  and whats worse  this timeno apology  not even a  sorry about that or even let me see  nothing  the worst waitress experience ive ever had  i even conciously noticed if she ever said please or thank you and the only time she said thank you  was when i handed her back the visa machine  thinking back  i should have not tipped  grrrrr  so now  i happily take back my 3 stars and begrudgingly give 1 star
i dont understand how this place rates so highly food is horrible and reminiscent of frozen food you get at the grocery store
went there for an important business lunch  4 words cockroach in my lemonade  and i drank some of it already before i saw it in there  note that for the rest of our lunch  my lunch partner and i had to examine every bite of salad to make sure there were no bugs in it  not enjoyable  the server was very apologetic  which was nice  their exuse was we just fumigated and it mustve gotten into the hose that feeds the lemonade  gross  i was trying to get over the horror of a cockroach in my lemonade  but every time i would tell a friend and try to laugh about it  my friends were terrified  so  i wrote a letter to the manager a few weeks after the event and never heard back  isnt this like a super bad health hazard  note to management thad  that is you address your clients letters  i took the time to express my dismay  even if its with a written response and nothing more  do something  a written apology wouldve been nice
i love chinese food but just not this one i agree  this should be given two  not one i have never in my life not not taken home my left over chinese food until i ate here the meats were hard  dry  veggies old i tried to like it because i like almost everything  but no bueno my kids were pretty ticked off at me for choosing this place because they hated even their favorite foods here they love family thai  fong noodlemmm we ate here before i discovered yelp  so sorry about the delayhahaha
we went here on a monday night as new delhi was closed  we would have been better off picking another cuisine instead of substituting with tandoor india  the staff were so dour that they would have been better suited for working for a funeral home than a restaurant  all the food was mediocre at best and the selection on the buffet was very small compared to nd  we finished our pitcher of water and were not provided a refill  the rice in the rice pudding was overcooked and i got very bloated after eating here  a reaction i have never had in the past to eating anything  my fiance had the same outcome
rude that is the best description of the service trying to run a overdressed pizzeria like you are the line cook in some 50s retro diner is not effective also it would help to actually pay attention to what the customer is ordering i was overcharged and then barked at to retrieve my order from the other counter on my own  only to look at my food and find the one item that i had made a change to wanted it left out wasnt even done save your money and go somewhere else
mixed menu with multi national cuisine usually not a good idea the sushi tasted frozen and the sushi rice was kind of crunchy  but not in a good way the sashimi was flavor less the waitress was attentive but not all there we ordered a bottle of sparkling water and she only brought us one glass with it the meal came with small corn bread muffins as the bread supplement which were decent the spicy tuna roll was goodif i wouldve bought it from morton williams i mean   all in all it wasnt a horrible experience or anything but compared to other places in the area it was bottom of the barrel maybe it was just an off night
while a student at uwtrying out the restaurants was fun except this place  service is horrible  the food is not even good  and another restaurant that likes to demand a tip and has the nerve to make the waitress check the table for a tip i tend to not tip especially when they made us wait 15 min for a menu and the food was served cold  edit i wrote this review last year  for my experience that i had five years agoand i tend to not go back to places where ive had a bad experience im sure things change over the years  and who knows it may even be way betternew owners  new servers  new cookwho knows    i only wrote this because i thought that thats what yelp is for  to share your experiences
this place doesnt even deserve any stars at allmy first two times were fine and i enjoyed it  but then i realized ehh the food isnt that great and i absolutely hate when people demand a tip from me  first they need to work on the food  then the service and i dont care if youre an asian restaurant  you dont demand a tip
i was sad when honeybees was gone  i really miss the quesadillas with the fries  and the sandwhiches  when it became yummy bites  it was just oh another asian restaurant  i went to yummy bites with some friends after a career fair and was craving tofu soup  a friend and i shared the soup and bulgogi so disappointing  first  my soup was not hot  it was luke warm and tasted mostly like yucky flavored water then the bulgogi looked like boiled meat floating in colored water sprinkled with something  sad to say  did not enjoy it  theres other restaurants id rather go eat at on the same block
yeah  most aesthetic things and environmental factors surrounding this store suck  as is adequately covered in reviews  but this is not my biggest problem does anyone realize how much stuff costs here you can recognize their absurd markup when stuff goes on sale like 92 off  youd probably spend less grocery shopping at pike place market safeway has to have the worst valueperdollar of any grocery store i am aware of with the possible exception of qfc  which costs more but is owned by the same conglomerate  ie same suppliers different packaging  its not like there arent other stores nearby any student whose little rational economic man allows them to shop here should not be allowed to graduate
blech i wish they would have given me the precooking raw ingredients and sent me on my way  ive never cooked chinesestyle  but dont see how i could have possibly been worse off actually  i think they just ladled all our food out of one of those used grease disposal bins in the alley  this is the slimy chinese food that movie  sitcom scripts always make corny jokes about sucking  not the cheap tasty chinese takeout that has generally been my reality  to add  this was the first time anyone in our group had been here  and we hadnt read the yelp reviews  so we didnt know that you could order lunch at 8 pm our entries were like 10 bucks double suck  and why do all these decent reviews start out with  yeah i know the foods not that good  but its so cheap i can mix some leaves and dirt together  top it with used motor oil  and have a pretty cheap meal  does that necessitate a three star review especially when good maybe cheaper food is within peeing range of their front door
completely terrible a real shame  it seems like such a fun place to go  pad thai is probably my favorite southeast asian food i know good from bad this was awful  burnt dry not in the authentic way  either vegetables shriveled flavors off asked for 5 out of 5 spicy  not spicy at all  bitterness from adding spices late  plus  miserable hostess who gives dirty looks  and overcharges she charged my girlfriend and i 19 for two pad thai dishes  takeout we thought it high  but couldnt verify the price was wrong at the time  because they had no menu with prices listed we found out later  and learned this is not unusual to be overhcharged on purpose  will never go again  im new to seattle  and still looking for good pad thai in u district any suggestions
please dont eat here ive had my fair share of indian food  and ajanta is in my bottom two bland spiceless food  lacking salt  half frozen peas  disgusting and flavorless worst 20 ive ever spent go to murray hill for awesome indian food  not to mention the ambiance is tacky and horrendous
tucked away  i would have always missed this place if my friend hadnt taken me for lunch a deli counter surrounded by wines  various condiments and the greatest plethora of imported sweets  they make mega large sandwiches for about 7 each theyre not overly fancy  like what you would find at panera or le boulanger  but theyre definitely a step up from say subway or the safeway variety the sandwiches were great for their value  and tasted pretty good but the counter service define irritated define unpleasant it was some of the rudest  disoriented service i had ever experienced i had just gotten to the counter and was reviewing the inconspicuous menu when the woman behind it asked for my order there was no one behind me  and i said i needed another minute when the woman rolled her eyes  huffed and cursed under her breath very audibly to her coworker about how i was taking forever i had just gotten there then to top it off  her coworker could not figure out how to group my friend and my order  even though we had explicitly said at the beginning  repeatedly  that our orders were together when they couldnt get it figured it out they got frustrated and did the whole evil glare like it was our freakin fault they didnt hear the first 5 times i never want to go back again they probably have the most random collection of obscure and imported chocolates  and that itself is pretty entertaining but crappy service and not bad but not amazing sandwiches the bottom side of my dutch crunch was soaked in sauce and mustard  rendering the bottom half mushy  no thanks note  also  the majority of goods here look like theyve been around since the 50s and i dont think this would be the ideal place to shop for your market needs such a disappointment
mama dips  1 pricey for what you getskimpy  skimpy servings 2 bland and tasteless or toooo greasy  3 disinterested wait staff  did rachel ray really try the food   i dunnowe tried it about 7 years ago and were disappointed theres people who rave about itso weve tried it a couple times since we always walk out regretting that we stopped in
what am i missing   why is there a line  mediocre food at best   a dirty establishment that needs a good scrubdown  why oh why are so many people fans of elmos i guess its a good thing  otherwise they wouldnt be in business but after all the raves you just have to try elmos  i just dont get it  ive tried it for breakfastif the bar isnt set high  its palatable  ive tried it for lunchtheres so many other places with so much more flavor  ive tried it for dinnerehtiresome  the best i can guess  its location  location  location   save your money and go elsewhereimho
seriously do not give these horrible people the satisfaction of ripping you off     this business is pathetic  their wings are the size of my big toe  the lemon pepper wings taste like my sack after i just got done skateboarding all day  the service is horrible they dont have napkins just really really cheap paper towels  to be honest with you when i bit into one of these puny bch wings i wanted to throw up everything i ever eaten
this place gave me food poisoning the only time i chose to grab fast food on the go  i saw this  and i regret it staff is not friendly what so ever
ugh  i just think dp dough is gross  unless youre drunk and its 2 am  no  even then  just go to hot truck  you could use the walk
ive been here a time or two while ive lived here last time i got a tall latte and a meager slice of banana bread  and it came to nine freakin fifty nine fifty nine fifty it wasnt anywhere nears good enough to qualify that price  and the guy who took my order was indifferent to me and a jerk to the folk he was managing me no likey i do not recommend this place its always too loud and crowded  anyway i hate to tout the starbucks across the street  but the coffees the same and its cheaperbelieve it or not
you can get a pretty damn big beer here  i screwed up and wanted wine  and got it in a coffee mug  wonderful  oh and the hookah is ehh  alright  to tell you the truth  i dont get places like this  if you wanna smoke like this  go buy some flavored cigarettes or something and stand in a circle with your friendssame effect  way cheaper  if you wanna drink  this place is a joke except for the gigantic beer  and if you wanna eatwhy are you here
again  brewco proves to be one of the worst bars ive ever been to  on days that i dont feel like driving to a bar im left with either maloneys oharas or brewco  for some reason my roommate didnt have his current id on him  but he did have his expired one  maloneys said they couldnt take it  then brewco said the same  we waited outside while our 2 friends went to use the restroom and my roommate and i were discussing why his id wouldnt work  i personally dont understand it because the id was issues legally and the information is all the same and he could even verify with other forms of id  one of the bouncers heard this and jumped in on our conversation to tell us that we were wrong  its no legal  why dont you learn something  this asshole kept going on and on and wouldnt let it go  he even told the other bouncer i love getting a rise out of people  he told us to leave  even though we were on public property  and we told him we were waiting for our friends inside  he responded with ill go in there and kick their fucking asses out too  we even tried stepping further away from him  so hed stop provoking us  but sure enough he just kept at it  i and other friends have had too many incidences with bouncers at this place  some of the bartenders are no better  another yelper referred to these guys as sadistic and you cant help but see it in their eyes  even with great service this place is only worth about 2 stars  no matter how badly i feel like staying in westwood to have a beer i will never spend a dime at this place again
boba loca used to quote jesus christ on their plastic cups quite frankly  that creeped me out i just want to drink my fucking boba  man can you leave the lord out of it  please   my korean roommate loved this place  incidentally not quite as much as he loved jesus  though
wow  talk about terrible service  today i ordered ahmos to be delivered to me at work the delivery driver called before he got here and asked me to meet him on the street  instead of the usual coming into where i am when i did meet him  he didnt have my credit card slip to sign  and insisted that i pay in cash  even though i gave  the credit card number over the phone he put me on speaker phone  still refusing to come into the business  and had me talk to someone at ahmos to put my credit card through embarrassing  standing on the sidewalk  giving my credit card number again i called back later  to explain the situation and describe the bad service the manager was not accommodating  instead telling me that he would speak to the driver twenty minutes later  the driver called me back to basically yell at me and demand to know why i hadnt left a tip and why i had called his manager   i think i wont be ordering ahmos again  which is a shame because their food is really good 
this place seeps of msg and gross frying oil ive been here once and i dont think ill ever go back  even if someone paid for my food there are plenty of other restaurants on the ave  go to those
i would have to agree with the previous reviewer this place was not tantalizing whatsoever my fajitas were extremely bland and had a pungent smell to it i was a bit concerned if i was going to catch ebola i didnt even come close to finishing my dinner   one star is generous
i used to walk past this place all the time for the last 3 years and finally had the opportunity to come here with my boyfriend we were craving pho  and normally we go to cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho i got excited we ordered the seafood pho  when it came i noticed there was something immediately wrong the noodles looked suspiciously like top ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but i dug in cos i was so hungry my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different it also had no garnish bean sprouts  basil  no lime  and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup   when we inquired the lack of garnish or lime  we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was special we then asked for srirarcha sp and got a tiny dollop of it all in all we paid 16 for beef top ramen with seafood floating in it it was very salty and unpleasant i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry  multiple theories as to why we were treated this way the couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the limeoil and rice noodles  1 we didnt look asian enough im filipino italian look at my profile picture and my boy is filipino but could pass for latino sometimes they were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we didnt know any better anyway  2 they were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund  3 a combination of number 1 and 2  i guess it serves us right for going into a chinese restaurant for pho but cravings serves multiple asian dishes as well and they got it right what made us the most angry is the fact that the asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied my boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right never again stay away from this place
super super sketch  drive through only people
we made reservation a week in advance and anticipated a great dining experience with family and friends in celebrating a special occasion  after making the reservation   my gf decided to visit the restaurant  a few days in advance to check out the decor and the size of the room that was reserved  the hostess assisted her in viewing the room and guided her through the dining room  before she left  she confirmed the reservation and the hostess assured her  that there wasnt any problems  low and behold  minutes after leaving the restaurant she received a phone call notifying that there was a  conflict in the reservation  the room in particular was already reserved for another party  she was requested to move our reservation to a different time if we still wanted that particular room  as we all know  it is difficult to make adjustments to scheduling especially when it involves a large group     highly disappointed  how can a restaurant of this caliber have a breakdown in communications  unprofessional and disorganized  nevertheless  my gf called back and spoke to a manager to cancel our reservation  management did not express any concerns or give an acceptable explanation  not even a sincere apology  wished we could have complimented on the food that has received several good reviews  however  we didnt even get a chance  i am a strong advocate of great food and excellent customer service  you cant have one without the other  if a business doesnt care about their patrons  why should anyone dine there  as a midtown resident  we will not return even if it happens to be across the street  lets just hope this review catches the eye of upper management and  corrective actions are taken    until then  be warned and hope that this incident never occurs to you
if this bar was a guy he would have a neckbeard
charlies kitchen remains the only place i have ever been cut off from im still not sure why   before i get into that  id just like to say that i actually kinda used to like this place i had probably been there for food  drinks at least 56 times before that incident i could have done without the downright shitty attitude of pretty much all of the american apparel black hoodie uniformed waitresses though i guess you could argue that it is part of the magic of going there oh and the absolutely disgusting bathroom it was easy to overlook with the decent food and cheap drinks for some reason though  i dont know why  after some god awful decision making my boyfriend and i ended up hitting this place up on st patricks day  it was packed inside but the beer garden was open  and we wanted food anyways so we decided to brave the cold and eat and have a few beers outside it was nice out back  and there was a fire going so we had a good time the bartender was nice  she messed up my order but i was still ok with it and didnt complain my boyfriend and i had 23 beers each  it seemed to clear out a little inside so we closed our tab there and moved inside and managed to get two seats at the bar the bartender up there was one i recognized from before  not entirely pleasant but par for the course i couldnt blame her tonight though  with the throngs of absolutely shitfaced college kids filling the place i think we both ordered one gin and tonic each at this point beer was being spilled on me by people walking by  most people were wrecked  she rushed up to us really quick and asked us what drink we wanted next  and my boyfriend hesitated because he was caught off guard and said umill take and she literally walked off midsentence to take someone elses order   ok whatever  so  she comes back a minute later  and we are prepared to give her our order  and she says um im sorry but i cant serve you anymore let me get your check then you can leave  i have absolutely no idea what made her think we were shitfaced i had barely a buzz on i hadnt even really been able to leave my seat and walk around   i would understand getting cut off many of the other several times ive been over served at bars to the point where im barely coherent   i didnt tip her i never not tip anybody i always tip a dollar per beer  more for a mixed if its a little more involved than a liquor and one mixer  20 for meals but fuck that shit   on the way out she yelled no tip never come back at us and honestly she was doing me a favor  have fun getting tips out of your mostly cheap hipster clientele who is more apt to spend their change playing in the aeroplane over the sea by neutral milk hotel on the jukebox than tip you
good riddance  this place was obnoxiously smug  the staff was inept  and the food was overpriced and terrible  really  the best part about this place is that it closed down
eww  what a dirty restaurant the place was not clean it reeked my group waited several minutes for the girl behind the counter to acknowledge us  despite the fact that she could see us standing there she wasnt friendly at all  and repeatedly gave us what huh looks when we indicated what we wanted one our burritos no thanks normally  i love qdoba but this location was awful  the worst part would be the bathrooms do not go in there go somewhere else or you may be scarred for life  so many better options around on mass ave that there should be no reason for anyone else to find themselves at this particular qdoba
my boyfriend and i dined at yummy maki yummy box for a 915pm dinner on vacation in la jolla yummy maki yummy box is a hole in the wall of a shopping center one large bottle of sapporo and one bottle of nigori was served immediately complimentary miso soup was unavailable and substituted by a bowl of teriyaki flavor and chives soup was tasty my boyfriend and i were rushed to order by our server our rainbow roll  spicy tiger roll  holiday roll and complimentary spicy tuna roll arrived in five minutes followed by the last call i specifically requested no mesago on the holiday roll and it arrived including extra mesago the sushi pieces are large  sloppily prepared and lack freshness the entire six tables of patrons exited the restaurant  my boyfriend and i remained inhaling our 50 worth of low quality fish and alcohol and the employees of yummy maki yummy box stood and stared at 950pm my boyfriend and i exited the restaurant followed by the employees of yummy maki yummy box to describe the time it took to meet health and cleanliness standards
my boyfriend and i were driving up to sf and hankering for a snack wanting to make our trip quick  we hurried over to firestone only to see a line out the door dismayed  we headed for another place we had noticed on our walk overmos  now i dont know about everyone else  but when i tell someone i have a serious food allergy to milk im not saying it because im feeling picky or dont like cheese im saying it because im fucking allergic to milk plus wouldnt you think that when i asked if there was any milk or cream in the beans that would imply i couldnt have cheese on my sandwich i expect to be taken seriously  the first mishap was understandablemaybe the cook just forgot or something but when i took it back and told them that i was allergic  they wiped it off with a cloth and brought it back 30 seconds later with bits of cheese still on it my two reactions were  1 you thought you could fool me  2 holy mother of all things unsanitary  finally  they took it back again and brought another sandwich out a few minutes later if it takes you 60 seconds to fire a new piece of chicken and you can make my boyfriends pulled beef sandwich in 30 seconds then thats a bad sign that beef must have been sitting in a warming panit was watery and tasteless  conclusion theres a reason firestone has a line and mos doesnt pick the former
aw hell no  we tipped 5 on a 1239 order 3 slices of pizza  1 order of garlic bread  cos we did delivery even though theyre pretty close went up and opened it to find that  1 the slices were stacked  and the cheese basically ripped off all the pizzas  2 the pizza was thin and soggy 3 i ordered chicken as a topping 40and got onions and garlic instead what 4 garlic bread was kind of tough  got stale when it cooled within the hour  which means it was stale bread that was just reheated  nope probably never again since theres a lot of pizza around la
ugh  terrible service and terrible food  j  i were in desperate need of nutrition after spending most of the morning trying to drag our hungover asses outta bed  nacho mamas was the first place we walked past  so we just decided to go in  we were seated outside and the waiter brought us water and some chips and salsa  we put in our order and waited in anticipation for our food  and then we waited and waited and waited some more  our chip supply had been gobbled up our water had been guzzled down  we were in dire straits  despite the fact that there were at least 8 servers and bussers and floor managers walking around  we were largely ignored  there were maybe two dozen patrons  so it wasnt even busy we asked 3 different guys for more water before we finally got some  the waiter reassured us that our food was on the way at least 4 times    40 minutes after we had ordered  our chopped salad and chicken nachos finally arrived  and they were totally wretched  gross  the beans in the nachos werent even whole beans  it was just some weird brownish liquid that tasted of beans but was weirdly flavored with some sweetish coconut stuff  the salad was just a salad and they only had one kind of dressing  some housemade citrus vinaigrette the guacamole was pretty tasteless as well  never going there again
this was the spot my first year then the racist bar tender told the police my friend was a criminal  they nearly kicked his door in  and proceeded to hold him and his fianc hostage only to realize they had the wrong people what caused the mix up the men were both black  needless to say since this incident ive never given this place a penny   the service was subpar this year anyway before this incident  my friends and i used to hang out here for a nice meal since the fool at our schools dc is subpar at best once thisone umass kid cant think of his name left  its been downhill ever since as far as service goes we always left him a 20 or better tip i hoped it helped   the food used to be amazing but earlier this year prior to the whole race debacle  i had some ribs that taste like they were never barbecued and were cold in the middle as if they were half cooked yuck   im never going here again
the service was really slow i believe it took 30 minutes to get my food after the order was placed i had the ranch skillet nothing impressive youd probably get something better at dennys for half the price the cinnamon dipped apples that came with it was disappointing too i believe it is their apple pie filling  which made me not want to order the apple pie i contemplated going again only for the red velvet waffle but after reading the other review  sounds like that is not even worth it
what the eff yamato  now i completely agree with jill t but heres my most recent yamato experience   yamato  i initially gave you four stars but with your horrific service and attitude towards your customers  i give you 1 star   my experience i came here with my friend sam n and my other friend patrick m i ordered shumai  which did not come until 15 hours later  with no apology  no nothing an hour and a half later for shumai this was supposed to be an appetizer this was supposed to come out before my sushi i was sad and hungry also  sam ns baked lobster was cold in the middle and her portions were so small  our waitress  never checked in on us which is also why my appetizer took too long and we were sitting right behind the hostess table  not to mention  it took forever to get our check and leave my best friend is a sushi waitress and i can understand the restaurant is busy  but it doesnt excuse the lack of amiability or attention to our table  this is really not okay  the reason why i gave yamatos 1 star instead of 0 was because of jesse  my last waiter  who really made an awesome impression on our table and gave us the extra attention i never see at this restaurant i sincerely wish that service was replicated at every single order of yamato  daryl w has made an awesome point word of mouth is a powerful tool and i have already seen jill ts review on facebook with my fraternity brothers and my friends talking about it   peace out  yamato after the piss poor service and mediocre sushi  im out of here
toms is the worst restaurant on earth  but between naive columbia freshmen and tourists  every single booth is packed  all day and all night dont be fooled the food is awful  the waiters are surly  and everythings overpriced walk down broadway theres plenty of other diners that dont suck below 110th
sadly  i have had to update this review for a third time even though harlem tavern is just down the street from us 3 blocks  and we have tried time and time again to give this place a chance  our most recent visit was enough to repost  let me tell you a little story we arrived at 9pm for drinks because the barinside area was completely swamped  we asked for a table for three we waited around for 40 minutes in the crowded bar area  and were seated in the patio section at 945 as soon as we sat down  we met our waitress  a woman who put down the menus and said are you gonna order food we said no  we just sat down and have already eaten  just drinks id like to add she never once tried to sell us the food  just demand that we order something   a few minutes later  she comes back are you gonna order food you have to order food to sit here  this is my table because we had waited 45 minutes and were never told by the hostess that tables were only for food weve been here 1015 times in the past  and this was never the case we asked if shed make an exception because it was now 10pm and the hostess hadnt informed us  then she starts to tell us they have a new policy a few minutes later  she sends over another server to harass us about ordering food  again  who pleads you just need to order one appetizer  thats all after this  we were fed up and told the staff we would rather leave  she wouldnt bring us the check and disappeared as a result of such poor treatment  we didnt leave a tip   on our way out  we spoke to the hostess  who said the server went rogue and that there was no such policy she even said shed buy us a drink next time we visit i have no idea whether ht has a policy that requires all patrons at their table to order drinks  or if this was just one territorialinexperienced server  but either way we dont plan to return or recommend this joint to friends any longer   sorry  ht  but youre going to have to do a much better job training your staff if you want to succeed
oh man  i really rooted for this place  we were all so excited for a new spot opening in the neighborhood something thats soulful  and characteristic of harlem at large heck  its called harlem tavern  wrong  heres my list of complaints   bad food the mussels in garlic white wine and sweet potato fries were served coldgross but since i had to wait a while for my food  i didnt want to risk sending it back and have to starve for even longer the shrimp cerviche was also halfass done ive had the real stuff in south america so my standard is set high and sure  ive had comparable quality here in the city and lets just say  this cerviche is a 1 out of 10 based on authenticity and taste   limited menu expensive and apparently crappy appetizers  salads  and burgers they all had comparable prices so  theres not much of a price range in your menu choices   limited selection of beer for it to be called a beer gardentavern  its embarrassing that the local supermarket 3 blocks away has a better beer selection   tacky decoratmosphere again  i think we all wanted more character to this place the decor was boring and standard the paintings look like they were bought at a discount from walmart they were playing radio hits right  i really havent gotten enough of lady gaga from the radio alreadyit ressembles any of those tacky tourist joints at time square that i would never venture into and in this case  i only gave it a fair chance because it was brought to my neighborhood  i am thoroughly disappointed
staff is unfriendly they only do take out when they are in the mood which really drives me mad i called and asked for takeout and this is how it went down  me id like to place an order for takeout unpleasant employee we dont do takeout after 7pm me but its 620 unpleasant employee we just dont have time for it right now  dial tone after they hung up on me
so i stopped in today because i was aching for some authentic italian food and was too lazy to cook it myself   what a mistake that turned out to be now  i figured that given the prices this was not going to be the best italian food of my life what i was not prepared for  however  was the sheer blandness of it all the cream sauce was watery and flavorless  and the shrimpscallops were no better i got a sneaking suspicion that the cooks are not familiar with the concept of seasoning the food   now  i was going to give this place two stars because of the value  but regrettably 20 minutes after i finished eating my stomach started doing backflips needless to say i will not be returning
dump   for what you get  overpriced  do yourself a favor go to fresh  easygrab the ingredients  make your ownand actually enjoy a meal
against my better judgement  i ended up eating here again my coworkers wanted come here for whatever reason being the team player i am  i joined them i should have not ordered anything  but i did and i got a little extra surprise a foreign object in my food it was a piece of string or twine and it weaved its way into my rice when i brought it to the attention of the tiny little cashier who looked like she was about 12 years old  the underaged child slave laborer just rolled her eyes and asked me with tons of attitude  do you want another one  well  yea because my stomach was not designed to ingest twine  bitch  when she brought out my replacement rice  i didnt even get an apology when i brought this to her attention  she replied  i didnt do it it aint my fault all that was missing was the south central neck roll i just about lost my mind  if i could downgrade this review to zero stars  i would    original review  i ordered chicken katsu  a side order of calamari rings  and a soda the katsu was decent nothing spectacular  but for the price it was okay the calamari rings were breaded and deep fried they were not crispy there was something mushy underneath the deep fried breading i suspect that it was the uncooked batter whomever was in the kitchen could have let the rings sit in the deep fryer for a couple of more minutes  luckily  my soda was not flat  otherwise i would have knocked one star from my rating  one of my dining companions ordered a sushi roll i was offered a bite i took one as i was eating the sushi roll  i was reminded of that old cartoon i used to see on saturday mornings as a kid dont drown your food they drowned the fuck out of that sushi roll so much so that i couldnt tell what the fuck was underneath
had to wait one hour for food cashier didnt want to give free samosa as advertised on yelp and acted pissed off after i pulled up the website on my phone to prove that the deal really existed  food tasted like it came out of a can bland and generic left the restaurant with a stomach as empty as my wallet
listen  i would choose any local deli sandwich over subway in an instant  but if im in the mood for a crappy fastfood 5 dollar footlong i want it  and i want it faster than the 25 minutes i waited to get it the line was not exceptionally long  the service was simply slow and unorganized how many people does it take to make a sandwich apparently the answer is six thats right  six unhappy and unmotivated workers to make one sandwich i wouldnt be too happy or motivated to work in those conditions  but they wouldnt call it work if it wasnt fake it till you make it guys  so  a deserving 1 star i know  its subway  a chain  how good can you really expect it to be i dont even frequent subway that often  but when i do i expect it to be just as any other subway experience fast and easy they dont call it fastfood for nothing my most recent visit to the drexel subway location was anything but  when you have such a successful chain such as subway  anything with their name on it is probably under some type of quality control customers expect every store to look  smell  and function exactly the same drexels new subway location has unfortunately fallen through the cracks
i went there for the first time for dinner 6pm or so on a friday night  there is only one buffet line to gather all the food you want the cook to stir fry for you  the rice in the cooker looked awful  it looked chunky and not fresh  the line was long and we were hungry  and the food choices were not that great  we ended up leaving the place and decided not to eat there  dont go here if you are starving and wanting food fast  there are several chinese restaurants that can offer more food and much quicker at a lower price than real chow baby  i only went there once and would not go back again
this location is dirty and the food simply sucks  the booths had stains and dried up residue on them  the window blinds were super dusty like they havent been cleaned in ages  low quality food and it lacks good service  this deters me from ever going to another applebees
stay away stay far  far away  this place is like the lady gaga of food theyll throw everything but the kitchen sink at you in sandwich form  fries  cheese sticks  fried pickles  onion rings  eggs  mac n cheese bites  jalapeno poppers  fried mushrooms and more  i know  in theory  it sounds pretty good but trust me when i say that its overwhelming there hasnt been one phat sandwich that ive liked  their wings were also the worst ive had pizza was subpar the panini i tried fresca panini was sickening  summary  only go here as an absolute last resort
dont come here for food i really wanted to like this place since i love the kendall cinema and a lot of the new foodie options opening up in the area  but the appetizers took about 30 minutes to come out the servers were incredibly rude and spacey the sriracha wings had hairs or feather remainders as the waiter claimed garlic parmesan fries were over fried flatbread caramelized onions werent actually caramelized and the fish in the soft tacos was neither fresh  well seasoned  nor cut properly   the menu looks promising but execution is a complete joke seriously there are so many delicious restaurants around kendall no need to go here
at night the store closes its doors for maintenance and daily financial matters from 23am countless times i have stopped by btwn 3 and 330 and the store is still closed i can understand if you were busy and closed later than normal and were behind  but thats why we have pens  write in a new opening time   what is wrong the white kids at night who listen to loud rap music with nr for every other word ever hear of work appropriate   your customer service and reliability are lacking
so  like i said  i normally dont review chains  but i gotta do this bc this place gave me ogeda recently and i will never go back to this particular wendys  so i pull up in the drive thru after a brief excursion at marshalls in the same shopping center and begin to drop my normal wendys spiel  which is 4 combo  medium  dr pepper but this time all i could get out was 4 comb and the dude on the speaker cuts me off to ask what drink i wanted dr pepp again  cutoff to ask the size med okay will there be anything else in a hurried tone i was about to jump through this speaker and choke somebody before i could finish saying  no  thats it i was told to pull around when i pull around guess what i see its the manager taking orders  it wasnt even busy enough for him to be taking orders with the amount of workers there this is previous white castle shift manager experience talking i said woosah a few times and let it slide i dont have time to eff with a fast food manager on his drivethru etiquette now when i go to the wendys in morrisville  this meal costs 740  i have my exact change ready to go for some reason in princeton  this same meal costs 8 i know they can charge differing prices  but it seemed odd  and just added to the bad experience then when i get home an begin to pull the contents from the bag  the fries are in disarray as if trying to escape the bag  and the outside of the burger wrapper was covered in slimy grease i noticed later this grease had soaked through the bag an onto my passenger seat   grrrrrrr nevergoingback
ugh  so i try not to write reviews unless they are positive otherwise  a quiet word with the manager is usually a kinder option however  i was shocked by how bad the service was just now and rather than chewing out the starbucks employee who yelled at me  i thought i would let my thoughts be known on yelp  it probably will have zero impact on starbucks  but hey  bad service is bad service and over priced coffee is over priced coffee     yes  being a barista is a hard job i know  i was one too but frankly they were not that busy and just downright rude and nasty to me the place was dirty and when i asked for milk that was non halfandhalf for my coffee  the barista literally yelled at me call me old fashioned but doesnt the service industry imply  ummm  good or decent or minimally civil service is it too much to ask that someone do something that should already be done  ie they always have at least 2 or skim also out for those of us who cant tolerate halfandhalf   so  dear yelpers  be aware  if you want a cup of coffee you are far better off walking down to espresso royale or sweetwaters  heck  i would chose micky dees any day from now on and given the stupid amount of money i have spent at starbucks in my life  i probably will and my wallet will thank me
im not a fan  that hasnt changed  the four star review  i suspect  is largely the result of the value for college students on a budget  consistent with my earlier review  the downgrade of my rating is largely theoretical  maoz loses a star because its no longer open late night  it closes at 10p sunday thru wednesday  and 11p thursday thru saturday  instead of the original 2a  while i do not anticipate eating its substandard fare ever again  its principal allure  late night eats  has faded into oblivion
went to minami sushi tonight with a large group of friends 20 for a birthday dinner we were the largest group there  but there were 2 other small groups 58 and a few couples long story short i waited for over an hour and a half for a spider roll and received no water refills people in my group and the group next to us had to ask the waitress for water  soy sauce and soy sauce dishes   maybe it was due to the fact that they may have been understaffed but the service was miserable and when my sushi finally arrived it was pretty bland and not the right temperature a friend had a bowl of veggie udon which lacked in the veggie department  blasphemy   1 star for having legit ginger and nice sushi presentation
silky tofu  delicious curries  mediocre thai iced tea oh and weird scraps of metal in my food but the waiter took the thai iced tea off the bill as a consolation the real consolation im still alive to write this tale
sorry hi rise  you lost a customer today and sorry  hipsterthanlife attendant  if your professional life didnt turn out the way you wanted  and now youre stuck serving coffee and pastries to people that you believe to be so below you but listen  the reality is that you work at a bakery and thats what you are there to do  serve coffee  pastries and sandwiches if you have any angst about the job you have to do  the customers are not to blame and theres no justification for such condescending and rude attitude ive been a customer for a while  but ive had enough of you  i do have one thing to thank you for because of your poor attitude  i walked away sans food and decided to get my breakfast sandwich over at crema what a great discovery  they had a huge assortment of delicious looking pastries  great sandwiches  and an upbeat  happy customer service
i was excited about indochinese fusion i had it in india best damn chicken corn soup i had  which is what lured me in they had chicken corn soup on the menu they had an appetizer  entree  dessert lunch deal going on for 12 i sat down for a solo lunch on the patio on a beautiful day  service was unacceptably slow  corn soup was a culinary disappointment  too corny  no other depth of flavor like thickened corn water with corn in it  desi chili chicken  i ate the bell peppers out of it because the chicken maybe the breading were inedibly salty inedible  waited an eternity read 25 minutes for the check guy even got my check and then forgot about me and i had to ask for it back and then when he came back he had split my 20 into smaller bills rather than use the money to pay the bill idk what was going on there  dessert was ice cream on a plate with sparse noodles around it   terrible  ok not that bad but i hate when bad food and bad service waste my time
i went to cardullos today with my husband to purchase champagne for some mimosas we were planning on making  we have washington state ids and were prompted to show them to the cashier  who also happens to be the owner  this was no surprise of course  shed want to check our ids before letting us purchase alcohol  however  she opened up a book that shows pictures of state ids to verify our id  and apparently our two washington state ids did not match the id images she had in her book  and she refused to let us purchase the champagne  while i appreciate her thoroughness  i am completely appalled that she would not let a married couple in our late twenties with multiple credit cards and harvard ids purchase champagne  our washington ids are from july 2010 we have no idea why they dont match the picture in her book  but clearly her book is outdated  and  if we really had fake ids  wouldnt we take even more care to make sure our ids match pictures in a book used to check for fake ids   i will never shop at cardullos ever again as a result of this humiliating and atrocious service  big mistake  huge
pros good food  interesting ambiance  cons extremely poor service that overshadowed the positives  in early february  i was planning an important dinner for a business friend in town visiting some graduate students  i thought upstairs would be the perfect place for an intimate dinner at one of my favorite upscale restaurants in cambridge  two weeks in advance  i made a reservation for 7 people at 830 pm on feb 15th on the upstairs  intimate dining level  the night before the dinner  i received a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for 830 pm  when we arrived at the restaurant  we were told in a joking manner that our table would be ready in 45 minutes we waited 30 minutes  and after not a single update from the host or hostess  i went to check in on the situation  apparently our table was still not ready  because the party before us arrived at 530 pm and still had not paid their bill  we were instead offered a crowded table on the noisy lower level a jazz band was playing which would not have worked for what i had planned to be an intimate  quiet dinner  when i told the hostess that this wouldnt work for us  she was indifferent and said there was nothing she could do  she ignored us from that point on  our party awkwardly waited near the jazz band for our table to be ready  and finally  at 930  an hour after i had scheduled the reservation  we were finally seated  after this atrocious service  i expected the host who seated us to offer us  at the very least  free drinks  but the host offered nothing and i was too embarrassed by the whole situation to even ask for anything  while the food ended up being fine and the service during the meal satisfactory  i am really upset that a restaurant of this caliber treated our party so poorly  i can understand that this was the day after valentines day and perhaps the restaurant was dealing with capacity issues for belated valentines day celebrations this is what the host told me after we finally were seated  however  the restaurant knew i had a reservation for 830 that night and should have planned accordingly   i am really disappointed with upstairs on the square i have frequented this restaurant a few times before and have never had such an issue   the restaurant screwed up pretty royally for what was a fairly important business dinner for me and i have no plans to visit this restaurant again
worstpizzaever   hifis pies dont come close to being north end pizza or even digiornos the crust is hard and tasteless  the cheese is used sparingly  and the sauce tastes like it could be tomato paste   if youre thinking of stopping by for lunch or dinner  definitely keep walkingyoull find something else in a oneblock vicinity this place is only worthy of the desperate  drunk college kids wandering around the central square area but guess what kiddos hate to disappoint you  but not everything tastes good when youre drunk  hifi pizza included
yuck  the only good thing that i can say about this pizza is that it was delivered pretty quickly  other than thati am totally disappointed  thick  greasy  flavorless crust  the veggies all tasted like they came out of a can slimy and even the cheese didnt taste good   i have been a happy beautys pizza customer for the past year  and regret branching out  i would never order from this place again
this place has some much going for it  that i am always surprised by how bad it is  awesome location  right outside of central  with parking  really good looking pastriesbut for some reason  it just doesnt work  it sucked when it was carberrys  and i was really hopeful that when lyndells bought it  it would get better  ive never been to the lyndells in somerville  but ive always heard good things  my biggest complaint is the people who work here  its like all of their employees are terrified of people  they run away rather than asking how they can help  and they do everything sooo sloooowwwly  normally  if im at a coffee shop in the morning instead of at home drinking my own coffee  its because im on m way to work  which probably means im in a hurry  which probably means i dont have 15 minutes to stand in line while the 4 people behind the counter accomplish absolutely nothing  the food tastes ok  nothing special  and majorly overpriced  i would love to have a great bakery right in central  and i would go all the time  ive learned that the bakery at whole foods is my best bet  and will continue to take my business there  good coffee  great pastries  helpful employeesand you can grocery shop while youre there  i just decided to give lyndells another shot today  because it always looks so temptingi literally stepped over a raw chicken breast right inside the door  when i politely mentioned it to the gal who made my sandwich  she acted like she couldnt care less  or why i would be bringing it to her attention  a raw chicken breast  on the floor  ewww   i will not be making this mistake again
first time in and ill never be going again seriously dont even bother going  common sense is something people should look into when hiring staff  i walked in  placed my togo order with the girl at the front  specifically first order not for me  then my order  then an appetizer   i paid and change was 51 cents not that complicated but she somehow gave me 11 cents small issue but ridiculous that she looked confused when i said it wasnt 51 cents   i told her i was going to wait outside for the order she said ok and that it would be 20 min my phone died so i lost track of time but when i went back to check on the order because it seemed like a long time she said here you go i asked how long had it been ready and she said 10 min i assume she just thought it would be a good idea for me to wait outside till they closed and then maybe i would go in and check on my food she just stood there and didnt know what to say i think a so sorry would have sufficed  the kicker was she put both orders of sushi rolls in the same container it was two orders only reason i was particular was because im allergic to seafood and i had the veggie rolls while my friend did not   never again no way no how
ridiculously understaffed only 2 waitersbartenders working on friday night thirty minute wait to order and then to pay
chicken kitchen  clean your kitchen  and the rest of the place while youre at it so  ive been wanting to try this place for a while  its close to the gym  the menu promises to be good and i love some rotissed chicken  heres my story walked in at 7pm and the restaurant is moderately busy  i see there is a family meal that i can get to go and opt for it  too bad there was no rotisserie whole chickens availableat the dinner hour no less  i was told there would be some in 10 minutes  so i decide to wait  i grab a seat and begin to check out the place big mistake  dirty  dirty dirty birds here  the kitchen area needed a serious cleaning and the chopped chickens looked rather dry read  old on the grill  the dining area had not been attended to in quite a while either  after my 10 minute impromptu inspection  i decided this was not the place for me  chicken kitchen  too bad i did not get to taste the food  but i think it just was not meant to be  call me when you get your act together and clean up a bit
i want to start off saying this place went from great to horrible over the past few years  i have heard that they changed ownership  i went last sunday and ordered a hamburger and fries  guess what i got food poisoning  because two hours later i was so sick  my wife ordered the mango chicken salad  well there was hardly any mango three and a half small strips and almost no dressing  the service was okay  but it took a while before the food came out  my friends in line before me had their food 10 minutes earlier    i had the italian cream cake for dessert  but it was okay at best  so basically if you are looking for overpriced mediocre food that potentially can cause food poisoning  then this is your place
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed  on my most recent visit  the waiter was overbearing  the menu confusing  and the food unremarkable  avoid this place
they had mints at the door when  you left  that is about the only nice thing i can say
i cannot adequately express the shame i feel for having the nerve to suggest this place for a mini girls night out i think eileen c already broke it down but i just have to put my 2 cents in and say this place has some nerve it was seriously empty and still we were brushed off like some drop in visitors which we were but hello they are a restaurant wait oh i get it now it wasnt a restaurant that makes much more sense it was an empty room of tables with rude people avoiding eye contact with the confused people who had the audacity to walk in makes much more sense  it is crazy to me that i gave this place 5 stars before i was vegetarian at the time  that is the only excuse i can think of the shame
do you enjoy fragrant  exotically spiced indian food made with fresh  flavorful ingredients if so  this place is not for you hunger  and the absence of a wait drove us to palace of india one warm friday evening when all other princeton restaurants were hopping i looked forward to fulfilling my craving for good biryani which was among the dishes featured in the very reasonably priced dinner buffet   well  as my husband astutely noted  you get what you pay for and no wonder there wasnt a wait i couldnt believe that every buffet item was bland and the harsh  unpleasant textures immediately extinguished my appetite i usually love warm creamy palak spinach with soft cubes of paneer cheese here  the grainy  fibrous palak and hard  rubbery paneer was clearly undercooked the vegetable korma may as well have been dessert given how sweet it was the chicken tandoori was slimy and cold actually all the food was cold after a few bites id had enough   id last visited this establishment a while back when it was known as kalluri corner and the food at that time was decent i suspect the management or ownership has changed  hence the poor quality i will not be going back here and neither should you
so let me begin by saying that  in my experience  i can leave an establishment happy  even if the food or product is semi mediocre  if the employees demonstrate sincere and friendly customer service with that stated  the food at cielo is not excellent  it isnt terrible either however  i could have been pleased if the staff we encountered had been actually sincere and friendly not fakefriendly theres a huge difference either way  heres an account of my latest experience  three girlfriends and i arrive at 10 minutes to 6 when their happy hour ends on a wednesday afternoon we were seated promptly  at a table with no napkins or silverware  and a busser quickly brought us chips  salsa and waters our server however  took almost 10 minutes to approach us when she did  we asked if we could still receive the happy hour discount on drinks and appetizers at that very moment we could hear the clock chiming 6 at the mission  and our server simply said only if its before 6 not a yes or a no she evaded the question with a passive answer  even though all of us could clearly hear the clock chiming 6 pm i told her  politely  we arrived 10 minutes ago and were looking forward to the happy hour prices  hinting with out being outright rude  that wed appreciate the discount since it is barely turning 6pm and we had been sitting there for 10 minutes well  she said shed check with her manager  we each ordered a drink and an appetizer i ordered wine  but tasted my friends passion fruit margarita it was fine  but oddly thick even though it was on ice and not blended kinda weird  but flavorful i ordered the ceviche  which was good  nothing spectacular  but good like i mentioned before maybe i would be happier with the place in general if the service was better  but i think poor service makes the food taste worse when our food came we still didnt have napkins or silverware and our waters were all empty i had to ask for napkins and water refills she brings the napkins but no silverware they are roll ups so i figured my statement went without further explanation we needed the full roll up  silverware and all however  apparently she was too distracted to notice we didnt have silverware my friend asked for a fork  and she giggled oh  i didnt realize you didnt have silverware well duh  youre only our server  arent you paid  to notice these things weve only been here for 30 and youve walked past our table 20 times frustrating  needless to say  we receive our bill and no discount was applied for the happy hour specials i didnt bother bringing it up with her we paid the full prices  which are a bit expensive  and went on our way  i just dont understand  why when all it would have taken on their part was to give us the happy hour prices just priceless moments after the clock chimed 6pm  and we would have all left much happier terrible first impression of a new restaurant in a very crucial economy for new businesses  on a positive  i also really enjoyed their chips they have flour and corn tortilla chips a nice touch i havent had most places
is it really so hard in a city the size of atlanta to have reasonably good asian food in midtown     i like the location of mu lan and the cute house it is in  but the food is the same as one would get in a suburban strip mall in anywhere  usa  disappointing  i know my standards can be high i lived in southeast asia for a few years but  really  why is it so hard for a city the size of atlanta to get some good ethnic food that doesnt require a drive to buford highway
i wish i liked this place   i live upstairs and it has a cute patio  but the food that used to be average seems to have gone downhill  and the prickly pear margarita i used to enjoy seems to have been changed and now is too sweet and ive tried it on different occasions  wasnt just one day with one bartender    i had a craving for nachos the other day and went there for convenience  and ate about 4 bites  really  how can you mess up nachos     service is also slow  inattentive  and faulty   the last several times i have been ive had to ask for a side of salsa twice different serversbut somehow no one can remember to bring salsa  i havent tried the pizza portion of the menu i dont really get the concept of pizza plus mexican anyway  so i cant comment on that  until reading reviews  i never noticed the low health inspection score  but sadly it doesnt surprise me  prickly pear  you literally need to clean up your act
ive been here 3 times  the first time was on a pub crawl  a couple years ago  and i only had beer  and it was pretty good i like to try new beers and they have a good selection  the second time was also pretty good no complaints  so why the one star well i went here last weekend for dinner and drinks before a movie  and i went home with more than i bargained for food poisoning after spending a day over the toilet and another day in bed too weak to move  i will never go here again i probably wont even be able to walk by without dry heaving
alright  heres your pal the boston bachelor back with another review  getting there  practically on top of the harvard square t  dress  casual  atmosphere  na  crowd  usual mix of late night halfsober people  bookworms  and 1 or 2 homeless people on a saturday night  food  stale  drinks  no booze  servicestaff  my buddy deep got the indian discount  guy who manages it is pretty cool  bottom line  wouldnt come here to recover from a night of drinking  definitely not for the food  it might be better during the day  but ill leave that for you to try  and finally  bathrooms were clean
doubt there is hope for this place bland overpriced food  dated old dirty decor  barclubintimate restaurant atmosphere fruit juice n seltzer water served and charged as an alcoholic beverage when confronted bartenders  one male  one female  didnt couldnt even deny the fact dont go
usually i invest a real effort to make my reviews interestinghumorous to trick you into continued reading no sarcasm  no hyperbole this time  but a true 11 scale outpouring of emotion  thisplacesucksbitesblowset cetera i will never come back here read on  let me tell you more  we waited 30 minutes to order from waitress x and waited another 31 minutes afterwards all 6 occupied tables had food on it  regardless of whether they had come before or after us the reason for tardiness invest every available second to harshly wither our burgers into oblivion  every burger was garnished with coal the one wrap we ordered was edible  because there was no cooking involved there i heroically complained to the waitress and manager about my burger not being medium  nor well done  but black and crispy as if blessed with fire and brimstone from mr pointy horms himself i showed him the burnt cancer underside of my burger the manager got angry and proceeded to school me all up and down about charbroiling direct quote follows   the grill top is hot therefore the burgers burned its part of the charbroiling process   it was my turn to give him an angry look i asked if he would make another burger  and he shot back that any burger i would get would have the exact same char i studied the man in front of me for 25 seconds in silence hark do i perceive in front of me the rare and hard to find idiot  did i need to show him that even a onearmed man can flip a burger  starting to look a little nervous  the manager broke the silence by asking me if i wanted him to make another attempt i said no he then asked me if i wanted my order to be made for take out i said no he then walked away i was livid within me was an enlarging node of primal anger that could grant me the strength to punch straight into my victims and withdraw internal organs   my companions could tell i was upset so they asked for the check the manager came back and informed me that he had taken it upon himself to take my order off the check he then proceeded to chum it up with me by asking me if i had any plans for the rest of the day i extricated myself as soon as i could before my dam of hungerenhanced anger burst  0 stars for service 0 stars for food 1 star just so yelp will register my review and post it
this is a sad review  because om started out great  it was  pricey but worth it  service was great and the atmosphere at both bar and restaurant was fantastic  it slid down hill fast  im not sure how they manage to stay open  there is more history in my old review  its gone from one of my favorites to 1 on my most loathed list among places that are still in business   ive had two bad experiences with pricey restaurants in the area  one was at upstairs on the square  one was at om  with the square  management seemed truly appalled  explained the situation and did everything they could to make it right   our followup visit was fabulous and the owner came by to thank us for giving them another try   upstairs were paragons of accountability and concern for the customer  om on the other hand  gave me a huge run around   it took many calls with promised call backs never coming before i spoke to someone who said he was the manager  he made promises that were never kept and left me much annoyed     everything ive heard suggests the food quality has slid further and the sevice and managment have not gotten their act together   looking through reviews  almost all the favorable comments are are about the bar  ill be back to upstairs on the square when i want a pricey meal  i wont be darkening the door at om   41410  tempted by a half price coupon  i checked in with yelp for signs of hope at om   dining experiences still look very negative  bar reviews are mixed  there are plenty of better choices at less than 12 oms prices
the lobsters were the worst weve tried they smell and leaked chlorinated water so much that we even didnt finish them that was the first time in our life  both of us are just crazy about lobsters  and had them a lot thanks for a great evening
this is the worst indian place i ever tried it never attracted me to have a dinner  however i decided to give them a chance and bought a coupon for 30 off the bill that was supposed to be a good motivation and i lowered my expectations but the service and the food was soooo bad that lowering my expectations was not enough to start enjoying the place regarding the food  me and my wife ordered appetizer with shrimps shrimps there were so small that its taste was fully absorbed by chickpeas and yogurt  soup it was ok  tandoori grill also ok and seafood masala it was not tender at all that would be ok unless all entries were served 3 minutes after appetizers of course  we ended up having all the dishes on our small table we also ordered sweet and salt lassis  however  waiter brought us mango and salty lassis the last thing we were surprised with is our waiter we decided to reduce her tips  but she took the check before we left looked at her tips and started to insist to raise her gratuity can you imagine that
peopleread this before you decide to go here   i really enjoy korean bbq  and being that this place is right around the corner from my house i decided to check it out one day my first impression was that the place wasnt too bad  maybe 35 stars its def not as good as a real korean restaurant but still not bad for fast food   however  i just got back from this place and i am unbelievably disgusted i asked for the spicy chicken and the nice guy at the register told me it would take 10 minutes so i got the bbq chicken which had already been cooked earlier in the day while waiting for the guy to make my plate i observed the cook spraying orange chemicals near the grill  actually right on the metal less than a foot away from 10 spicy chicken breasts that were 14 way cooked he did it once and i thought  okmaybe it didnt go on the chicken then i saw him spray it againand then a third time very liberally and yes  the orange chemical spray which says do not drink on the side was spraying up all over the cooking chicken especially on the ones that were closest to the metal he was spraying i mean  as he was spraying the grill was making noise like when you throw water into a fire omg  i was disgusted i told the cash register guy and he looked surprised and i told him that i didnt think i would be coming back   i got home and reluctantly started eating my food the first bite of chicken tasted like rubber and it was sorta pinkish insideso i recooked it in a frying pan it still tasted gross  i think some of it has to do with my disgust at the whole chemical situation  but also cause the chicken really did taste like rubber it didnt taste like that the last two times i came here anywayi wont eat here again if the cook and the 3 other employees that were working back there doesnt realize that spraying chemicals next to cooking food is a hazard and downright disgusting then he will never understand how to cook food properly   eat here only if you want your future kids to have congenital deformities i am seriously considering banning all fast food after this experience you can really only trust homecooked food nowadays
this place blows a big one the server was great at first and convinced us into some expensive sake and then he forgot about us he forgot about one of our rolls and then tried to tell us he already brought it out to us then he acted like he was doing us a favor by bringing out the roll we never got we didnt see him again for 20 minutes and we were waiting patiently for the check boy  i wished id just walked out the check was around 100 bucks for two people for mediocre sushi and terrible service dont come herethat is unless youre a complete masochist
i used to like this place  but now they put a weight limit on how much you can get  if i remember correctly it was like 5 lbs for meat and 5 lbs for noodles and like 5 veggies or something like that my question is how the f am i supposed to know how much my sht weighs to the decimal lb do i look like good will hunting to you i was packin my bowl as i usually do and the cashier lady and one of the cooks starts bitchin at me talkin about i got 1 lb of beef in my bowl wat is the point of even goin to mongolian bbq joints then
i recommend ordering through eat24com thats the only way you can get your money back when this place disappoints you   i ordered and it took 90 minutes i order wings  baked ziti and chicken parm sandwich the wings came wrapped in foil and were soggy because of the condensation the chicken parm was barely warm and the chicken wasnt even breaded i may not be italian but i know chicken parm is supposed to be breaded the baked ziti was sort of ok but the sauce has a weird not too enjoyable aftertaste   needless to say i will never order from here again how can one place screw up so much and still have 3 stars
im not sure who owns this franchise but they are totally wasting their money on rent they dont even have any ice cram in the place i went a while ago and all of their tubs were virtually empty i totally had a hankering for a hot fudge sundae i was disappointed but i sucked it up and headed on over to 21 choices
for this company affair  we had a cut menu  fish filet  steak filet or pumpkinchicken ravioli i ordered steak  my immediate supervisor had the fish and our assistant was forced into eating the ravioli since she couldnt recall exactly what she reserved ill get to the point quickly gross  bland  disappointing the steak could have been anything  but it didnt taste like anything but refrigerator the mashed potatoes lacked any discernible spice or flavor  and the broccoli tasted like the steak the pumpkin ravioli served with chicken cubes  most succinctly summed up in the following quote can i just say that i will forever remember that meal as the most disgusting one ive ever had it was bland and tasted neither like ravioli nor pumpkin  nor anything else that she would ever put in her mouth again the fish dry and overcooked with bone remnants so large  our poor guest had to excuse himself from the table to spit them out we were  however  served a great shiraz and i had the strongest tastiest hurricane that thoroughly rocked me
well normally i do not one star a place unless i have been there twice   well i have  i ate about 3 months ago there and the food was horrible  i went there tonight for a concert aka benny  i got kicked out by the the bouncer for moving sideways on the dance floor which was followed by being let back in by the bouncer because i seemed fine both the man who escorted me out and the bouncer could not say why i was escorted except his dsp bro said too i rate this place one star and my friends parents own it disappointment if you go to native  head across the street to an actual bar bulls   cheers native never getting my dollar again
bleh  i have tried a lot of food at la terrasse and its all bleh  spinach salad  bleh pizza  bleh steak frites  bleh  maybe its because i dont order from their dinner menu  but from their bar menubut their food is very lack luster  head elsewhere
the service her is terrible  our server forgot our drinks and we had to remind her four times  then she was pissed off that we kept bothering her with requests for napkins and forks  the food was over priced and not very good
worst restaurant ever
last week  four friends and i went to hirise on a wednesday  after getting our food  we went upstairs to try to find a table  the place was full of people camped out with laptops and coffee at 4top tables  when we asked a staff member if there was anywhere else to sit remember  were all standing around holding a basket in one hand and a drink in the other she said no and disappeared  we ended up eating in the conference roomtheater of the next door community center  with the curtains drawn  bottom line get takeout  or eat outside if its nice but dont come expecting to eat in
i dont like the texture of the crust i know thats what people go for when they come here and they enjoy the flakiness  but it is just not my cup of tea the crust to topping ratio of some of the pizzas that i got were also not good   the mixtures of toppings are pretty creative  but other than that  im just not into it its the crust that really throws me off
a typical night at studio 4 would consist of the following  1 waiting in line for 12 an hour in the blistering cold of michigan  figuring out whether the girl in front of you is wearing a tube top as a skirt  and dealing with the jack ass bouncers who have just begun their careers as club bouncers  building up their resumes in hope of one day ending up in la or nyc  as part of the alist of bouncerskeep dreaming buddy  2 once you manage to not get thrown into the cement by the bouncers  congratulations  you have passed the first stage  now your next task will be to manage not to get kicked out because they will find every reason to do so  a few tips  dont wear hats  dont fall asleep on their couches  dont have beef with the bouncers or bartenders  dont have beef with the rest of the people in the club  dont drink to the point where youre so drunk that you get kicked out and have the nerve to stand back in line while dressed in a halloween costume in hopes that the bouncer will not recognize you  and then reaching the point where you are banned from the clubyeah i happen to know someone whos had this happen to her before  i know her really well actually    3 so  once youre finally in the club  chances are youll probably see an empty dance floor and wonder why the hell they made you wait outside for 12 an hour  this is called strategic marketing  4 once you realize that your hoedar is excessively sending off signals  that everyone around you looks like a serial rapist  sex offender  or just plain wasted to the point of no return  you will decide to join the wasted to the point of no return group and head straight to the bar where you will rack up a tab that you will cry over while hugging the toilet the next morning  5 eventually later on in the night  you will realize that you have to make that dreadful trip to the bathroom  since im a girl and i dont have the luxury of relieving myself in 3 seconds  i usually have to wait in a long line full of crying  emotional wrecks who swear they will kill the bitch that their boyfriend was grinding up on the dance floor  once you get through the door  you will also have to push yourself past the girls blocking the 2 bathroom stalls who think taking pictures of themselves with the bathroom as backdrop will look hot as their next facebook profile picture  if youre lucky which you probably wont be unless you go clubbing at 9 pm  you will be able to get a toilet either not overflowing with puke  feces  or flooding the rest of the bathroom with toilet water  be careful when you wash your hands too  chances are someone thought puking in the sink would be a better idea than puking in the toilet  so there you go  i think ive had more fun clubbing in my bedroom with the disco light i won at chuckie cheeses  the only reason why i give it one star is  not just because yelp does not give me the option of choosing zero stars  but i have to admit  some of the funniest memories that werent funny at the moment of occurrence happened here p
meeting streets business model sell the cheapest food possible in outrageously huge portions thereby convincing people that theyre receiving a bargain  lets look at an example a cup of coffee it costs over two dollars for a cup of regular drip coffee why because rather than serving it in a humanstyle coffee cup  they serve it in something more resembling a small vat heres the thing big wide containerhot coffeesoon to be cold coffee  so its not like youre actually gaining anything for paying for more because  this is america  and you get free refills anyway and its not like the coffee is anything special its just that by giving you a ton of it and you are momentarily blindsided by sheer enormity and do not realize that you are being ripped off this same fault can be applied to everything on their menu  their menu itself is enormous  schizophrenic  and the great majority of what actually comes walking out of the kitchen while portioned for giants or something is bland  unimaginative  sad this isnt good breakfast food this isnt good deli food and it sure as hell isnt good dinner food i feel sad for the person who pays 12 for the chicken and broccoli when they could have walked into the vdub for essentially the same thing i wont even comment on the utterly strange decor  their lame policies like ending breakfast at noon on weekends  or how flipping rude the people behind the counter are rolling their eyes when you ask for a glass of water i know they have to deal with a lot of students  and that can make anyone jaded  but for gods sake  you made this bed  eat in it and go look up how big a sandwich is supposed to be   there is one reason it makes sense for people to go here they are byob and do not monitor it at all once you turn 21  go down to georges and have a real sandwich
lets put aside the obvious issue of authenticity for a moment and discuss the real problem quality their food is disgusting for a reason its really  really cheap everything comes of a bag the soups come out of a bag  their guacamole comes out of a bag  the empanadas are prefab and frozen  even their house recipe hot sauce is actually just from a big cisco jug their business model is simple flashy decor  glossy menu  and steep prices means that people will believe that what theyre eating wasnt frozen on a truck that morning its a really sad way to treat customers  employees  and the community these people dont deserve to make money
everything that comes out of this place tastes like its been frozen i think its sad that the same guy whos tricking wickenden into thinking abes is a bar is tricking the hill into thinking this is bbq while  yes  this is the north and we cant expect great bbq  united bbq is not great bbq  not at all
horrible  they ought to call it side order plantation as there is no real food here  like someone blow said  it feels like they are hiding the entree buffet stations   it disgusts me that there is no real protein anywhere  unless you pay extra for the baggie of chicken for the salad
120507 its really tough to get me upset or disappointed  but this place seem to have accomplished that exactly walked in and was greeted and seated immediately the tables were so close together it was a little annoying people who sat next to me can literally just share food with me mine as well it was not crowded or busy just good amount of people sitting too close to each other  the waiter had the craziest accent ever it was really hard to understand him  i had him repeat the specials twice he told the specials to two tables at a time i mean he had to we were so close that it was almost as if everyone was one big table  of course bread was given to us by our waiter  and it was horrible it was hard as rock we saw other tables get bread as well but it looked really soft so we ordered another basket of bread with someone else and they brought us nice soft warm bread i think this waiter hate us its like he doesnt care i ordered the steak dish on the special i also ordered the pinot grigio the wine was great the steak dish was not steak it tasted like fish it was soft like fish and it has no steak taste to it yes it was smothered with some cream sauce and mushroom but no steak in there just tasted like fish and mushrooms i was very disappointed with my dish so i didnt eat it  the waiter came by and he try to take my dish away to get me something else i told him i didnt want anything else and its okay cause i already lost my appetite he grab my plate and i told him to leave it he kept on insisting and he end up yelling at me whoa i seriously was gonna slap him in the face asshole it was really intense argument he walked away and said well i dont know what you want hellllooo you freaking idiot i just said leave me alone i dont want anything else did i fckin stutter well of course that was all said in my head what a dumass i came with my good friend lily and she was upset too her dish was not good at all both disappointed we decided that you cant go wrong with dessert so we were right dessert it was i got the molton chocolate cake it was freaking good so one star for that thats it nothing else was good i forgot his namedamn that stupid waiter
i called this place to order some takeout  but the number was disconnected double checked the number on the restaurants website and there was no mention that this place is closed for construction
i really feel bad about giving a onestar review  first  its not about the service  price  decor  or the food  im writing this review after going there twice  the first time my husband and i went  the dinner was good  we thought this place has the potential to be our goto chinese restaurant in pgh  today i remembered that they have an earlybird special 36pm msat  the won ton soup was not authentic more like chicken noodle soup but wasnt bad  the entree was fine    what really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobaccocigarette smell from the tea     i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum  the smell wouldnt leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine 23 minutes then brush as long as i could to get rid of the smell  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray    first visit 3 stars  second visit 5 stars   2 stars
i will never again go here  im tired of the lady that always seem pissedoff taking my order or making me boba   last time my husband and i went  we checked their hours on the door and walked in the door was unlocked the lady yells at us  rather rudely  dont you see lights off   first of all the lights were not off it was dim it was our first time going after sunset we thought it was mood lighting   second of all as if the pissedoffed service wasnt bad enough  we had to be yelled at  i never thought their food was that great anyway ive heard my chinese friends say that shes nice well as a nonchinese speaking person  ive only been rudely serviced over and over again   go to little asia for chinese food and lulus for boba or walk in if you dont see the old lady working there
lovely red velvet cupcakes until i found a blonde hair in one of them ugh
ordered pad thai  crab rangoon  and beef teriyaki from here  the pad thai was terrible it was bland with zero of the flavor pad thai is known for it tasted like plain noodles with no flavoring  with a crap load of ground nuts sprinkled on top which is basically what it was it was a huge portion  but that means nothing when it isnt worth eating  the crab rangoon were overcooked to the point they were dark brown  though they didnt seem like they would taste very good even if they werent  the beef teriyaki was tough  and only mildly flavorful this was probably the better part of the meal  but would have only been recommendable if not so tough and overdone  i recommend highly against this place
roughly 20 or so years ago  this then teenage boy discovered a love for frozen yogurt  when the then it froyo chain opened up tcby stores across an unassuming massachusetts it wasnt ice cream  it wasnt soft serve it was yogurt and it was good  fast forward to today id been looking forward to this place opening after reading and hearing all sorts of things about this amazingly delicious pinkberry concoction that folks on the west coast couldnt get enough of passing by harvard square today  i saw it had opened  and walked in to tryand like the virgin who gives up her innocence to that ratty jock who claims he loves her just because he wants a piece of her pinkberry  only to leave her the next day  i find myself feeling more than a little bit of disappointment and remorse   in fairness  all i knew is that this place serves healthier frozen yogurt a sign on the wall suggested it is tart  which concerned me slightly  but only a bit when i put the first spoonful of green tea yogurt into my mouth though  i must have winced noticeably it tastes like the stuff is mixed with a ridiculously overpowering berryflavored powder  whose strength would put sour patch kids to shame  with the tiniest hint of green tea flavor  and so i am left to believe that this amazing treat ive heard so much about  is nothing more than hype tell enough people its brilliant  they will start to believe it despite their own tastebuds pair that with unbelievably slow service  and pretentious prices that such a hideous flavor doesnt deserve to charge  and i will surely be steering clear of this berry in the future
weve ordered a couple of times from this place  and honestly its been pretty terrible overall their pasta and sauce are bland and expensive for what you get   we ordered chicken fingers tonight  and they tasted like the oil they were cooked in hadnt been changed for a week and a half chicken shouldnt taste like various kinds of fish and clam   their fried raviloi were rubbery  and the sauce that came with it was watery and lacked flavor   there are much better places to order from in cambridge
i didnt enjoy the food or the experience  the food was poor quality  according to my taste most of the ingredients on the bar were frozen  and the sauces had that chemical  massproduced taste and aftertaste  that lasted for hours the rice was horrible  probably some frozen rice that hadnt been properly reconstituted  so the grains were hard and undercooked  the experience can be fun for some  but i do not enjoy standing in line after every few bites of food the bowls are very small  so you eat a few bites  and stand in line again waiting for the food to be cooked  my husband and i are vegetarian  so every time they would cook our food on the grill  they would take a lot of care to clean it first that was very nice of them  but i did not enjoy feeling special and slowing down the line luckily  it was not crowded that evening  the service was good  everybody at the lafayette location was nice  attentive  and hard working
this place was horrible and i will not be coming here again   the place is huge  lots of seating  looks small from the outside and you have to park on the street   i came here with my boyfriend because we are always looking for indianpakistani restaurants to go to  but this place was a regret the food was so bad  that we took 3 bites and left that was also 17 down the drain which made me mad   we got there and ordered so far so good  we grabbed water and sat at a table  and before we could push our chairs in  a guys brought us our food we both looked at each other like hmm that was really quick   so we tried our chicken tikka masala with our naan and plain rice  and the taste was terrible there was absolutely no flavor  the sauce was lukewarm and tasted like tomato soup it was disgusting not to mention  the chicken pieces are tiny and they give you a very little amount  this is definitely cheap  tasteless college food
so dirty  while having dinner  a guy from our next table jumps out of his chair to come over to us he points his finger at my husband and warns him not to freak out we are both scared by this crazy stranger  it turns out my husband was accompanied by the biggest cockroach he or i have ever seen in our whole entire lives it was as big  if not bigger  than those hissing cockroaches yuck yuck  we were so traumatized that we dint remember if the food was good actually we are still trying to forget that we even went inside this place
like shrada a read her review  i wish there was a 0star option my experience was almost as horrible as hers    the service  experience   we walk into the restaurant  and we stand at the front for a full 3 minutes waiting to be seated  even though the restaurant is empty the two employees at the register kind of glance over and continue their conversation  the waitress comes up to us  and right of the bat asks  for here or to go we say for here  and sit down she then comes to us in a few minutes and says in an annoyed tone  i thought you said to go she rudely props two glasses on the table and gives a exasperated sigh  the whole time the waitress has a look on her face like she just defaulted on her house loan  was hit by a pie on the way to work  and slapped by every customer that ate there today  every few minutes shed come by the tablenot to fill up water  but to eavesdrop can you believe this   she had a look like we had just murdered her children and she was trying to find out where we had hid the bodies so then she could kill us once she got that info   the food   terrible if the food has been even average  i may have given 1 star it wasnt   some of the most bland  uninspired trash i have ever eaten i think i can get a better meal out of a barn trough the potatoes were basically swimming in a curry that was water  and the cholay were served uncooked right out of the can  lukewarm and bland   parting ways   the waitress literally throws the check on the table  without us even asking for it i kind of wanted to get up right there and give her a piece of my mind  but i didnt want to ruin my mood for the bar we were going to next doorwhich by the way had been playing earsplitting music the whole time so loud the water in the glass was vibrating  this is absolutely the worst treatment i have gotten in my life  at a restaurant or otherwise this happened about a month ago but i didnt have the time to write and i agree with shradha  the free market needs to send this rathole a message

the food moderately priced but hardly good  maybe i shouldnt judge based on my one experience  but both my friend and i left with upset stomachs    theres much better curry in berkeley  get out of your comfort zone and stay away from these chains
overrated  the insane amount of sugary toppings testify to the fact that cinnaholics baseline cinnamon roll just isnt impressive  the texture is too squishy and everything is just unbearably sweet  vegan treats are no new thing
food is okay ive had better japanese food its not as expensive as joshuyas but the food quality is quite distinguishable  unfortunately  but why am i complainingtheyre supposed to be open till 10pm   10 pm my butt  not tooooo upset because at least it means theyre treating their workers well not working them overtime  but from a customers perspective  not too cool my friend and i practically ran here from the bart so we can make it on time got there at 930 but they refused to serve us because it was too close to closing boo
i would actually give this place a 05 stars if i could not only was the food bleh  the service was absolutely terrible the men working there were probably the rudest ive ever seen eating there for dinner with friends  some of us took our time trying to guzzle down the nasty food while trying to enjoy a nice conversation after about 30 minutes  one of the workers comes over to ask us to eat faster and telling us this is not a cafeteria hes sure right about thatthe school cafeteria has both better food and nicer workers
not excited about this place fine  i give a star for having tart yogurt and having okay toppings the fruit was okay  but some of it seemed canned and sugared  the yogurt tasted a bit grainy and even watered down the tart yogurt could be much creamier but it tasted like it was watered down   i wonder how they clean the machinesconsidering how many they have they cant clean all the machines every day especially when they clse late   and honestly  i think i would pay a bit more for quality im not excited to see piles of trash that cant be composted this is berkeley we need to learn to help our environment   sometimes it scares me to think what kind of germs live on the handles and spouts when a lot of people have touched it then  i saw some kids quickly putting their heads under the yogurt spout to eat itseriously not pleasing
no way  seriously no way  theres two types of yogurteven pinkberry got sued for using powder form and this one def tastes like powder formmaybe thats why theyre called italian delicacy instead of frozen yogurt  i dont know but ive tried it on different occassions and i really cant stand that it tastes artificialnot like yogurt at all  the  fruits were okay but there were various canned fruits like peaches and bluberries im not looking to buy things like thatid rather have it fresh since im putting money into it definately would rather go to yogurt harmony
overpriced and skimpy servings the place actually on telegraph just around the corner is far better
um  i was surprised at the amount of people that like this place  i mean there was nothing good about my experience there the shakespeare sucked ass  the sounds were loud enough  just indistinguishable everything about this sucked  and i had a pissed off girl she was not happy with my choice thank you shakespeare tavern
so  let me preface this by saying that i am a native new yorker i have spent most of my life there  and they do hot dogs pretty well any dirty water dog is far superior than the shit this place parades around as food the buns are trash  the food is trashits hard to ruin a hot dog  the place was packed for some unknown reason  and the staff doesnt seem to give 2 shits about anything i have no idea why this place is an atlanta institution  i have no idea how it is still open i will never go back  and my life is far worse from going in the first place they should just replace this place with a cardboard factory  or concrete factory  and atlanta would be far better served
72309 update the health department shut them down today  maybe tom will come out of the woodwork and start cooking again when they reopen  dont go until he does  this place use to be great  the best thai in seattle  and it was well worth the wait  the cramp quarters  the noise  to marvel at the cooking skills of tom  but now  well now tom is who knows where  on a thia beach perhaps taking it easy   and the people working there just dont give a dam in fact theyll tell you straight to your face you can go elsewhere we have many more behind you  now days  being asked to change seats  even midmeal is not uncommon it happened to us and the table next to us tonight  the prices are up and the quality is down  and its still just as noisy and cramped as before    if this restaurant was anywhere else in the city they couldnt get away with treating customers like they do  please  go elsewhere and let these jackasses get the message they need to treat customers with respect  just say no to thai tom 
granted  i was there only two weeks after opening  so they may have been just getting in the rhythm of menu choices and service  however  running out of three different dishes on the menu  the wine was a rip off  at 10 a glass for a small pour  not going back again
terrible service  food good im familiar with callendars menu  way outdated decor  the place needs a complete redo  the hostess ended up helping us with our order because the waiter was so slow  too bad  because marie callendars used to be so popular
incredibly rude staff
this is the robeks located right next to chipotle  quiznos and coffee bean in the usc area i have gone here a couple of times and the smoothies have tasted watered down they are pretty popular though with the other people i work with and in an area filled with nothing but junk food  we pretty much have no other choice with that said i needed to come here to get 10  5 gift cards for work we were giving them out to our weekend staff because they did so well with all the sales i came here last saturday morning and asked for the cards they were out uhoh now what i just promised my staff robeks cards i asked the guy is there any other way of getting a certificate or something he told me this is verbatim you could get 50 smoothies ok this guy is a moron for 2 reasons i am not stating his name just to be nice reason 1 i am not taking out 50 smoothies to my car and taking them to work to thank my staff for the great work they did reason 2 if i can get 50 smoothies for 50 that would be an amazing deal i kind of stood there stunned for a minute and decided not to say anything to him and left i went back 4 days or so later still no cards i asked when they would be in and the guy told me that when they run out they order them from the main office and they send them whenever they feel like it so either this guy is lying and that location is just lazy and never ordered them or the main robeks office needs to change staff to someone who will take care of their locations again i left empty handed i decided to email the main office i got a very fast response from mitch he gave me an offer that sounded ok but it wasnt for the 5 cards i had promised my staff so that offer didnt work out i explained to him that when other businesses run out of something that a customer needs they will hand deliver the items this happened to me with jamba juice before and they handled it much better after putting me on hold for a few minutes he came back on and said that there will be cards at this location in the next hour ok so trip 3 today i finally get the said cards but not after waiting 10 minutes for the girl to understand what i was purchasing and another 20 minutes waiting for her to ring it up mitch told me this service was not the norm but after reading the other robeks reviews it seems that it is the norm many locations are always out of cards and service is consistently lacking i will never get robeks cards for my staff again bad service and notthatgood smoothies
really rude people work here and they act like they dont know what youre talking about when you order a white chocolate mocha also  i went here 2 days ago and got a med sized drink then i went today and got a small today i paid almost a dollar more for my smaller drink when i looked at the menu reading what a white chocolate dream was i was looking on the blended side then the manager or owner guy older and bald raised his voice at me saying all of our drinks are hot or cold you need to read in the right place do you understand what it says i couldnt believe it so i was charged wrong one time or the other or both and the manager was rude and the server nancy acted like i was stupid ordering a white chocolate mocha instead of a white chocolate dream
im never going back here again  the only good thing i can say about it is that its cheap and looks clean  however  the falafel is ridiculously oversalted  which makes me wonder what other nasty tastes its covering up  the tahini is drab and flavorless  i respect amirs as a small business  but when im in the mood for falafel  i will happily spend twice as much and walk twice as far to go to maoz  this was gross
yikes terrible stay away   if you think ajanta is the best indian food youve ever had  youve got another thing coming a couple of pet peeves i have with indian food is when restaurants start throwing in broccoli and zucchini into some of their mixedvegetable dishes  and ajanta unfortunately does that at every available opportunity its a little unfortunate that ajanta is so poor  because theyve got such a great location right next to columbia oh  well
normally  i could care less about a mcdonalds because really  youre getting what you pay for  however  this particular morning i just wanted some coffee on my way to work  figured id check first to see if it was crowded  and to my surprise  nope    walked in  stood on line behind a gentleman and waited to make my order  except there was something weird going on  there were two employees in the front making coffee does it require that many people to make coffee with an industrial machine  no and four employees standing around in the back talking  why wasnt anyone taking my order  two minutes later  the gentleman in front of me gets his coffee and im left standing there waitingwaitingwaitingwaiting some morei look at the girl at the counter with the fake eyelashes on as she says to her coffeemate  i aint takin no orders until selisha or whatever her name was gets off her phone  really  so saidemployee selisha or whatever walks by on her cell phone chatting away  so i look back at the girl as she then looks at me    me  is anyone taking orders her  whispering to her friend i dont think they understand me  i said i aint takin no orders  thats when i realize i have walked into the middle of a sht show  i turn on heel and walk out  on my way out  i say to the homeless guy who holds the door open for me hoping for change  looks like youre the only one working here today  theyre not taking any orders  sheer incompetence  if anyone feels that theyre above taking orders as theyre working at mcdonalds  they should do everyone a favor and just leave  for anyone who reads this and is still considering going there to eatyouve been forewarned  dont count on anything good coming out of that place lol
used to come here all the time  the food was decent and the service was typically pretty good and accommodating if they werent stacked with customers however  they recently changed management and the last few times ive gone the service has been terrible even with the restaurant nearly empty apparently most of the older servers quit after changing management nowadays most of the orders come out wrong  drinks dont get refilled if you get them to begin with  and what food does come out is bad  dont really plan on coming back
i concur with the rest of these reviews skip this place ive had better cupcakes out of a box these cupcakes are dry  old and have crusty frosting  and if you still end up going  definitely skip the red velvet cupcakes
the mango slushee from the machine tasted like mold or cleaning chemicals  we couldnt decide  the samosas are okay and very spicy  this place has a cheap indian buffet that i havent tried yet
i wish i could give this place negative stars 0 for mediocre drinks 1 for weird smells 1 for rude bouncers 1 for long lines 1 for trashy crowd 1 because its earls why are you even here
nothing new to say  just echoing below sentiments  burger was thoroughly overcooked  and quite terrible  i asked them if the fries were the same as pts and the response was oh  the lemon pepper kind  yep  theyre the same  by that  i guess he meant they put lemon pepper on them as the one spice they could identify  because thats all they had on them just lemon pepper  remember how pts fries had about 10 different spices that merged for a delectable taste mmm  i wanted to like this place  i really did  i will never come back  and thankfully theres a buns for my fry fix
warning warning warning   do not enter if you are  a 33  b sober   mind you  im usually a make the most of any situation kinda girl but dang last night came here for karaoke after game 7  go lakers  i had a sudden impulse to line up all the obnoxious  belligerent  20something undergrads together and knock them all over with a bowling ball   highlight of my night here was when this stupid blond girl kept interrupting everyones karaoke song and was on stage beatboxing and singing along louder than the singer i asked the karaoke dj to turn off her mic since she was being so rude and annoying and when he did  i took absolute pleasure in seeing her tap on her mic and shake it to see what was wrong with it haha cheap thrills  
their table service might be one thing  but i ordered delivery tonight and it was a disaster  the food came more than an hour late a good 90 minutes after the initial order was made  and was ice cold  the restaurant did not call me to warn that the food would be coming late  i had to call them  i guess my tonkatsu was good once  but it was slimy and congealed by the time it reached me  wont be ordering again  wont be making a visit stay away from this joint
ouch the absolute worst brunch service ive ever experienced took almost 30 minutes and asking 3 times to get my cup of coffee  and a little longer than that to get my bloody mary ordered at the same time  food was pretty standard brunch fare  too many other options like zingermans to ever go back
i just cant recommend this place  unless youre interested in mediocre food at high prices served by inattentive waiters  the only reason i went here was to bring a group of family and friends this was convenient and could easily handle a large group otherwise  id never  ever go back
im amazed that this place has a 4 star rating  came here today and paid 10 for a giant size sandwich not only does the sandwich have barely any meat on it  but i could probably get a better sandwich down the street at fresh grocer  or subway for that matter roast beef and turkey is dry and tastes old  and for a place that calls themselves a deli to only have 3 types of cheeses is a little ridiculous   maybe i should try it for the egg sandwiches
pattaya grill is unfortunately the only thai restaurant in university city that delivers it is also terrible my girlfriend and i ordered simple thai dishes house salad  papaya salad  pad seeyu  and spicy squid all of these dishes were below average  with the exception of the squid which was inedible it was rubbery and not even cut in peices the house salad also was about as average as a side salad you would get an italian restaruant unless you absolutely need thai food delivery  dont order from this place go out or pick it up or get something else
i have been a few times  and i hate to give it a bad review  but here goesnormally  id give this place 3 stars good location university city  great food deals cheap wings not fantastic but cheap in price  1 tacos  3 for more substantial tacos are economical but ya get what you pay for  really also has generally good drink specials  but lacks on the higher quality brews that i generally go for all in all it  it is great for when you are a hungry undergrad that wants to get drunk with friends on campus perfect  good for you heres the bad part  service has always been terrible for the handful of times i have gone there their waitstaff doesnt seem to give a shit if they get your order correct the waitresses can look hot til the day is long but if you cant bring me what i ordered  go work at a strip joint   also  on our last visit  will be the last time we will ever go there we had the pleasure of finding a piece of broken glass in one of our pints some background for you my friends  i are phdeducated and very respectable citizens that kept our cool and brought this to the attention of the manager  mike mike said we didnt have to pay for the drinks we had ordered well  that was nice of him  until he lied to us turns out  he left the most expensive pitcher on our bill  so again we asked to speak to the manager mike in the full force of a complete asshole blew us off when we tried to explain to him that a trip to the er would have been thousands of dollars more expensive then a 9 pitcher my good friend almost swallowed the piece of jagged glass seriously  what complete degenerates do they have running that place
t bowl deserves an award for being the biggest insult to asian cuisine in philadelphia this place somehow manages to do the impossible and give you everything you wouldnt want to happen to a stir fry what makes a stir fry good well for one thing it uses high quality ingredients  remains unsaturated with oil when flash fried  and has juicy bits of meat scattered in and around the bowlrice  so what does t bowl do wrong let me outline it for you as follows  1 the chicken is probably the driest piece of meat you could ever sink your teeth into it sucks the moisture out of your mouth and tastes like its been cooked days in advance i dont appreciate cotton mouth for lunch  2 your stir fry is greasy as hell you could probably squeeze out a few ounces if you tilted your plate and fried a few eggs with it  3 the rice tastes like death its crumbly and old whoever made it obviously isnt getting paid enough   4 the whole concept is flawed its a fast casual restaurant that has a cool customization theme to the dishes that caters to students and then it overcharges you for everything  to the very last spring onion  5 the presentation of the dish sucks it just sucks have a little finesse in your presentation it takes 5 seconds to make the plate look infinitely more appetizing than seeing the oil splashes all around the dish   6 wtf kind of sauces are you offering what a terrible range of westernized tastes each one attempts to drown out the stale taste of the ingredients which i suppose was the objective  this was an even worse business decision than taglios  which actually tasted good on occasion   i was so excited to hear about this place when it opened  but never have i been more disappointed   what a shame  15
horrible lunch service  we waited 5 minutes to be seated  10 minutes to get menus  and 15 minutes for water when we finally got our burgers we werent able to flag down a waiter to bring us ketchup eventually we got so sick of waiting that my friend just walk up to the shortorder counter to snag the ketchup  never again
675 pretax for a salmon crepe salmon  nata cheese  and the crepe wrapping  my crepe arrives  no nata cheese  i ask the cashier for nata  sorry  we ran out of nata  i ask for a different crepe  the cashier refuses  and instead offers me ricotta i think cheese  i say wouldnt ricotta be gross on a salmon crepe the cashier agrees and says sorry  no offer of a refund  when an item only has three ingredients  you cant expect to get away with two
pro location is great  con sandwiches are bland and thoroughly mediocre  the caesar salad i got today was 7  and it had almost no caesar dressing  it did have a mound of supermarket lettuce and four burnt croutons  no thanks  coho  treehouse has a 5 caesar salad that is about twenty times better
absolute travesty of a burger asked if it was from frozen patties  and they told me no not positive  but im pretty sure i got a microwaved frozen patty utterly disgusting
you know when you hear something so disagreeable you bypass anger and move straight to sadness best burger in providence i honestly feel ashamed it is inedible as in i hadnt eaten in hours  had a few beers in me  love burgers more than almost anything  and still couldnt get past two bites it is a greasy pile of processed garbage unfit for human consumption onion rings sucked  too
first visit and never again irish bar my shamrock arse tattoo  20 minutes to get a waitress attention  and she was shocked by the order of two guinness and two shots of jack  she then disappeared for another 10 minutes and left promising us a menu 20 minutes later  we got a menu i looked at the food landing on the tables around us  and was not impressed with the theme of straight from the freezer to the fryer and talked my companion into going next door to the istanbul we spent an hour at oneals  30 minutes waiting for a drink  and the rest wondering what the hell was so popular about the place
i stopped for lunch at the cafe bistro while shopping at nordstrom this afternoon we were seated and had to leave the restaurant because we could not get servedafter 15 minutes we still hadnt ordered and we still had no water  it looked as though the waiter was responsible for most of the restaurant it was very disappointing and i dont plan to go back   this cafe is a definite step down from the old nordstrom cafe   we then went to pf changs on the other side of the shopping center we were seated immediately and received excellent service
i am a chipotle fan  that being said  this has got to be the crappiest chipotle in the la area   i work nearby  and it was only my love of chipotle that kept me coming back like an abused wife who doesnt want to press charges on cops  but ive finally decided to leave  slow lines  i waited 40 minutes to get to the counter to order my burrito crappy service  staff members here are rude and give you major attitude   quality  at this particular location  they really skimp on the ingredients   is there a short supply of sour cream   is it a steak burrito if a burrito has barely any steak  there apparently isnt a shortage of lettuce though because my burrito was 50 percent lettuce    long story short  this crappy chipotle franchise will no longer get my money  ill go to taquiza or chanos instead for my mex fix
i had never eaten here  before and being that i love teriyaki  i figured id try it  neon  dayglow cauliflower no joke that shit looked like battery acid if i had eaten it i would have glowed in the dark like the infamous radioactive spider damn  may be i shouldve eaten it  nah not worth  the possibility  vomitrocious
the single star is for the impressive beer selection the lack of the other three is for the overdone and overpriced fries and the terrible service  we waited over 25 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink order not even to bring out the food  but just to come get our drink order we had to go find the host to even get a waiter to come by our table and after all that  the food took forever to come out  and the fries were cold and overdone the beer selection is huge  but can be overpriced not worth all the hype and praise would not recommend
it was my first time here went on a friday night with friends after dinner to have some tea and chat because starbucks down the street seems overrated loud too crowded   the atmosphere was nice we looked thru the menu and the prices seemed reasonable i assumed when i ordered a pot 450 versus a mug250 for three of us  it seemed worth it wrong we ordered a pot450 that only came with one cup so i had to get three more cups for my friends  250 each for just empty cups and pay for more water i could have easily just ordered separate drinks   the annoying part was that the worker who took my drinks looked very unhappy and that he hated his job he looked like he didnt want to be there and didnt help me at all i asked him questions but when he answered me  i was still very confused   i dont think i will ever come back
update  i tried them again  just to give them another shot i dined in this time and ordered the same plate of drunken noodle yup  still bad  greasy and gross my friends laughed at me for taking the same risk with the same dish well  jokes on you guys  for eating at the same restaurant with me your dishes werent much better  either suckas  well  at least this time around  i got flat rice noodles
i ordered fordelivery on campusfoodcom  no complaints on this end  the food was quick and delivery was only 1    however  the food left a lot to be desired  i ordered general tsos tofu with fried rice  being vegan  i requested the fried rice to not include egg and they obliged  however  it seems egg is the only thing they put in their fried rice  because i basically got white rice that tasted really  really funky  ive never gone to a chinese food restaurant and had this experience  the general tsos tofu had an incredibly liquidy  noiwontstayonyourbroccoli sauce which in my experience is abnormal  as i have a bit of a general tsos sauce obsession  but the tofu was alright  it just really wasnt very good  at all  i definitely wont be coming back here  certainly not after experiencing the pleasurable dining experience i had at peking garden
i gave this so many stars because their wine was good  was in town visiting friend and she took me here  oh boy ordered the mac and cheese with pork first of all my plate had a hair  disgusting and the taste of the plate was horrible  never again the service was pretty decent though
avoid this place    it is obscenely overpriced  258 for a slice of cheese pizza   everything else is ridiculously overpriced  400 for a small french fries  they keep jacking up the prices  and lowering the quality  they also keep hiring new counter help  who dont understand the concepts of gloves and tongs    just dont bother  if you want cheap  fast pizza during lunch time  go across the street to star market  which has decent pizzabytheslice for lunch during the week  if you want tasty pizza  go down windsor street to the bertuccis on main  if youre looking for something other than cheap pizza  you were at the wrong place to begin with
dear lord  this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to  especially in terms of takingmaking orders correctly and thats really saying something
the only good thing about this place is the selection of 5 footlongs  the people making my sandwich were unfriendly there were no smiles on their faces  and they practically barked at me when they asked for my preferences sandwich making wasnt so hot either the veggies were unevenly spreads out  and the lady cut and wrapped my sandwich without even trying to close the sandwich made eating it so much more difficult than it needed to be  i really wish that i had read these yelp reviews before coming here the 5 spent on this sandwich could have been made for better use at a local restaurant
