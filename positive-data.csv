my first visit was a few days ago  but never the less  as i remember the soft savory deliciousness of my lamb shank  the couscous raining down my throat and the bouquet of roses that blossomed in my mouth with every sip of my lemonade  i drool im really starting to salivate now and need to push my key board out of drools way   the appetizer portions are for one person strange  i know  so dont go into getting an appetizer thinking youll share with a friend   the neighborhood is quiet and the restaurant is cozy  staff is very pleasant  and i am officially a fan  terrifically tasty tunisian treats for the tummy
i dont know why anyone eats ice cream anymore
im not a vegetarian or vegan  so when this place was recommended to me  i was skeptical i decided to try it  though  and it is so delicious i have been here a bunch recently and i havent had a bad dish  to order here  you choose one of three pizza dough  brown rice  or coconut rice and an entree to go on top they have daily specials which are delicious and soups of the week i just recently had tomato and lentil soup which was delicious  also  it is a small space and is part of a music club  club passim you will be asked upon entering if youre there for the show or for dinner you may have to wait for a table  especially if you have 4 people  and takeout is always a fast  delicious option also  before 4 or 5pm  there are no waiters  so you just place your order through a window to the cook  it is a little hard to find  take a look at the pictures on yelp its a basement and connected to club passim  so if youre going here at night  you may hear music from the club just follow that and youll figure it out  they also have 2 beers on tap and desserts
i just went last week the restaurant gets 5 stars because the staff is excellent friendly  knowledgeable  the food is superb  and the ambiance is great  one warning i went expecting real southern food i went with my mother  from texas  and father  from virginia  and told them it was southern it is not traditional southern  but still delicious my mom and dad both said it was great  just not real southern  i had the catfish  my mom had the chicken  my dad had the pork i loved the catfish  and my parents loved their dishes for desert  we had the peach melba that was the most delicious desert i can remember having if you go  get the melba its seasonal so get it while it lasts
this place is great they have a lot of cocktails  so you can go here plenty of times without having to drink the same drink twice  and they are all great they also have good beer and a pretty big wine list  though ive never had wine here  the food looks amazing  but i havent had dinner here yet i have had the chips and dip  though both the chips and the dip are homemade and so amazingly delicious  i wont look at chips the same way again  sundays are stout  oyster night  where with every stout you get  you also get a free oyster i love sundays here wednesdays are mexicantheme and they have a whole list of cocktails made with tequila they also have a mexicantheme snack list for wednesdays both nights are fun and delicious  the atmosphere is maybe the best part  for me green street has a cozy  intimate feeling while still having a chic feel the music is usually soul and funk  which i love  but there are other styles mixed in  the staff is friendly  and good at their jobs  if youre having a hard time finding the place  youre not alone it looks sketchy from the outside  but is amazing on the inside the best advise i have is to look at the pictures on yelp if you take a look at them  youll have a much easier time finding it
being so far away from pinkberry makes me a little sad  but now theres the bigger and better berry line a mere hour away in nearby boston though i wouldnt trek it just for froyo would i  tasting that good and still low fat is a beautiful thing regular flavor never gets old its smoother and creamier than pinkberry and definitely less tart  which is why berry line trumps pinkberry now i can add pineapple topping without my glands going wild  topping choices include your cereals  fruits  and chocolates personal fav fruity pebbles  banana  and mochi inside is quaint and cute as a button makes you want to sit and talk about happy thoughts
any visit to central will almost guarantee a visit to miracle partly because my friend works here  but morely because i just frickin love the vibe  the black top tables remind me of my chemistry labs everytime i walk in my eyes divert directly to that triangle table in the middle my mind runs and i picture myself having one too many beers  stumbling  and whacking my head right on the pointy part ha ha  anyways beers keep flowing  staff is laidback burgers jumbo  juicy steakeggs and very importantly their veggie burgers are the best ive ever tasted in my entire existence probably has a lot to do with the sauce its incredibly great
this is a regular stop for me  not only because it is within walking distance of my house  but because the sandwiches are so consistently and classically good   i usually go for the poboys  but also often get the falafel wrap the falafel isnt the greatest ive ever had  but its tasty and antones is the only place i know of in my neighborhood that serves anything like it in nyc  these falafel sandwiches are simply referred to as falafels and you can buy them from street carts all over town i miss that sometimes  and this helps to ease my pain  this  the original location  i believe  really beats the pants off any of the franchised chain locations around town i mean  either you know how to make a proper sandwich  or you dont its like understanding jazz if you dont get it  youre just wasting everybodys time the original antones gets it right  the store hasnt changed much over the years and still has an oldfashioned feel about it it makes me feel a little better that alfreds  the other legendary rice village deli that once graced rice boulevard  did not survive my childhood
its true that freds used to be kind of cramped  but they have recently remodeled and its now very nice and roomyi was really impressed with my most recent visits the service has been excellent i had kind of forgotten about the place  but i will be going back a lot more  to me  this is the way italian food is supposed to taste i can tell you that  as someone with a sicilian bloodline who has been raised on real italian food since birth  i am not easily impressed this places sauce is the closest to my moms recipe that i have ever had even my grandmother approved  lately ive been getting the pasta alla siciliana  a mixture of meatballs and sausage smothered in their excellent marinara with your choice of penne or spaghetti comfort food to the max
wowjust wow  who would have thunk that the best pizza ive had in a long time would be in atlanta  i was told about this place when someone suggested it to me when i was eating brunch when i first arrived in atlanta  i was told that they make really good pizza there  but i didnt come to atlanta to eat pizza  i thought  flash forward to a few days later  im driving around lost and looking for something to eat and then drive past antico  suddenly  my mind is recalling what i heard about antico and i turn around  there is a gravel parking lot with limited spaces for antico  it closes at 9 but they still allowed me to order pizza  they really dont do pizza slices or small orders of pizza  it comes in only one size and if you cant finish it  at least you have leftovers for tomorrow  it didnt take very long for the pizza to be ready and i ate a few slices in the kitchen with other strangers enjoying their pizza at a communal table
man  i have being having such great luck with food trucks lately maybe  it is because i am fairly systematic in doing my research before trying one or maybe it is just dumb luck either way  i will take it  now  i need to put something on the table  before last night  i had never heard of this truck so  i cannot really take credit for this one it was purely dumb luck that they happened to show up at the los alamitos event and  to tell you the truth  i wasnt much interested in trying their waffles i tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to dessert  if it doesnt have chocolate  not dessert in fact  i subscribe to the theory that apple pie is actually just fruit  so  i really have my lovely wife to thank for this discovery  as she announced  just so you know  we are getting a waffle  after enjoying meals from the lime and flip trucks for some reason  i felt like being easy go doesnt happen often and i surrendered to her whim boy  am i glad i did  i must say i was intrigue after quickly reading a few reviews in the cold and dark  desperately trying to make sure we selected the right dessert and  we did holy moly  we went with the holiday special  which consists of the best yummy waffle  amazing pumpkin ice cream and an excellent whipped cream finished with a powered cinnamon i think now  i realize a few of you might be wondering  but scott  this goes against your own dessert rule where is the chocolate like i said  i was feeling very easy going and went with the windows recommendation  now  usually any dessert without chocolate leaves me wanting a little more this more than exceeded my expectations the waffle was both crispy and gooey at the same time the trucks special belgian waffle recipe didnt disappoint in fact  i was actually convinced that there was apple inside the waffle and even went and asked the answer  no  dude  this thing was sooooo freakin good that between my wife  me and the toddler  it was gone in a flash it literally was one of the best desserts i have ever had  and i have had some pretty darn good treats around the world so  if i havent been clear and you are still waffling pun intended  this is not a truck to miss
place is great definitely not a place to take a serious date  i enjoyed eating and the small dining area made it interesting  my wife and i chowed down on everything  the guacamole and chips were good and the numerous other items we had were great  make sure you go hungry because you will want to try most of the menu    the staff made some great recommendations and everyone were friendly and hospitable
go with the sicilian pan  weve been eating here for years and it never disappoints  be ready to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a pizza  but its worth it  beer prices are not bad and service was great
i would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice the naan is really great too i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer  as well as the samosas i am not an expert on indian food so i cant tell you how authentic it is  but i can tell you that it is delicious
i had a great experience at golden harbor i would recommend going with a group of people because the entrees are rather large we ordered 6 entrees for 8 people  but i think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it  my favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken  the crispy tofu  and the pork buns the basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful the crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that i really enjoyed we assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat  a container of buns  and a plate of garnishes crushed peanuts  some sort of veggies  and cilantro the menu is very extensive  so be prepared to spend some time looking through it though you really cant go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu   when you arrive at the restaurant  you take a table number  menu  and ordering slip to a table of your choice then after you decide what you want  you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay it works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because im not sure that they allow separate checks from one table then someone will bring your food to your table tea is free  and you can simply serve yourself at the end of your meal you clear your own dishes  or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you
papa dels is my favorite pizza restaurant  and definitely worth the wait for delivery  ive experienced it taking everywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to arrive  but id say it is most often 4560 minutes if you are planning to dine in at the restaurant  i would recommend calling the restaurant about 20 minutes before you plan to be there to preorder your pizza this significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant take out is the fastest option my pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order  the deep dish pan pizza is their specialty the toppings are always fresh and delicious i order garlic on every pizza i get from papa dels because it is just so fresh and delicious im not a big sausage fan  but i enjoy theirs very much my favorite combination of toppings to get is garlic  sausage  black olives  and green peppers yum
delicious  delicious barbecue i didnt even know that i liked barbecue until i ate at black dog for the first time i recommend any of the sandwiches  and the spicy southwest potato salad is spicy and wonderful the corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside very filling and rich and tasty  you will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small ive heard that ordering takeout works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat  but i havent tried it yet the waitstaff are always friendly  though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food
i love this place they have some very unique sushi but they also have some boring ones so long as you order right  the sushi is amazing i recommend the flaming red dragon  i think that is what it was called the stir fry is also superb service is great also
free seaming hot tea love the crispy beef very large portions best chinese food out there
i got the lamb gyro and all i have to say is yum  oh and does anyone know how this cart is related to this cart httpjournalismnyuedupubzonepavementinshangrilaexpressservestibetanfoodoutofapushcart
i just want to give a nod to the people who work here  they can make burritos and run a cash register faster than i thought was humanly possible  ive been here a few times and its always busy  so it is good they are fast  wow  and its chipotle  so of course its delicious
its pretty difficult to convince meateating people to check out a vegetarian or mostly vegan  actually place but the ucsd hare krishna setup is one of the best places ive ever eaten at so i always invite everyone i believe ive convinced a lot of those type of people to continue eating at the hare krishna food even a year out of graduation feel like i finally accomplished something at ucsd luckily i work near ucsd now and still return on occasion  anyway  there are also lots of people using tupperwares or even bringing a normal ceramic plate  which is great to avoid using their disposableware   only complaint is that the lines can stretch extraordinarily long
this place is easily one of my favorite places to eat  and you will quickly learn im not a stickler for fancy dining  i just like good food   fiesta prepares their burritos as close to homemade as i have found  they make their own tortillas and sauces  as well as having a variety of fresh accompaniments to top or stuff in your food  ive heard the tacos and quesadillas are good  but i order a burrito every single time i come here  why mess with something so good  they let you choose your choice of fillings including rice  two types of beans  and multiple meats including a great grilled steak or roasted pork  then you can choose to have your burrito enchilada style  and let me say right now  do that  they top it with a sauce of your choice green tomatillo  green chile  or red chile  sprinkle it with cheese  and bake it  then you can add salsa  sour cream and a few other sides if you wish  this place has become somewhat of an obsession at work  with fiesta trips happening every other week  the food is outstanding  the grilled steak burrito is my current favorite  with green chile sauce on top  which adds just the right amount of spice and lends great flavor  if you live in lafayette and have not visited here  you are truly missing out
best mexican food in town  its located in small grocery store my kind of place and not only sells great things  but makes delicious food  i grew up near mexico  and this is as close to authentic that i have gotten in the area  the salsa is fresh  the sauces always taste just slightly different because they are made fresh every day  and the whole meal is always fantastic  the service is good and friendly  and their green enchiladas are awesome  they are working on expanding and adding another location i believe but they also do delivery and carryout
we dined at maza last night for the first time since they relocated  im very happy we made a reservation  as they had a wait otherwise  the decor is nice  and the place is small without being too tight   service was also quite good  we ordered a bottle of lebanese wine  which was fantastic   you can either get all tapas style appetizers or enjoy one of their entrees  they locally source their meat  which i really appreciate  had the sambousek for an appetizer which was quite light and good  my wife had the armenian chicken  which came with peppers and rice and was outstanding  its a simple dish and was perfectly seasoned  i had the lamb shank with potatoes and rice which was also wonderful  i appreciate the food is simple  not smothered in sauces  and very well cooked  overall a great meal  and my new favorite upscale restaurant in the area
dt kirbys has everything im looking for in a bar great prices  great staff  out of this world food  and oh yeah  its a bears bar   i cant recall how many times ive eaten here ive tried almost everything don  trish really have a great thing going for them  and dts is one of the biggest things i miss about living in the greater lafayette area   so here  are my favorties buffalo chicken sandwich bacon cheeseburger philly with cheezwhiz triple hog three different kinds of pig fried mushroomspicklesonionsfries with the secret fry sauce reuben sandwich reuben omelette every single hot dog on the menu  also  dont be a wimp  please refrain from asking for a knife to cut your sandwichburger bear down  get a freaking napkin   if you ask you ketchup  you will be heckled until you leave and rightfully so  normal people do not put ketchup on a hot dog  i love you  dt kirbys  and bear down chicago bears
authentic mexican food in the middle of a bustling mexican grocery store sits la guadalupana  one of west lafayettes best kept secrets   please try something that you wouldnt normally order the tongue tacos are fantastic  as well as the menudo you can tell this has been made by a family adhering to the quality they would make for their family the food takes a while because its made to order  so make time to wait    the grocery is stoked with awesome imported foods and a wide selection of beautifully kitschy prayer candles
flippin fantastic  our dinner here last week was definitely 5 star quality  the wine  steak  sides and service were all top notch  i liked the atmosphere a lot too  it wasnt too dark and even though the place was packed for a wednesday night you feel the isolation within your area  im a booth girl  so was a bit disappointed the only booths available were by the kitchen  so we opted for a table  if youd like a booth in a nice area  mention this when making reservations  they have tons of wine to choose from  the waiter was given free reign to choose from a white for us and he did an excellent job  i love the smaller entree selection  there are only three options  but i got the filet and the scalloped potatoes and it was the perfect size  as another reviewer mentioned  the service was great  but not overbearing  they give you plenty of time to finish your bottle and chat and leave at your own pace
five stars for some of the best pearls ive tasted in the bay area  theyre soft  chewy  and theyre not too sweet  plus  at 150 for a green tea with pearls  its a steal  id definitely come here more often if i lived in berkeley and not san jose  p
i work remotely  so the world is my office my tools my trusty laptop my search for free wifi led me to sip nursing a hangover from the previous night of rooftop debauchery  a bar was not what i had in mind  but i was drawn in by the lowkey  friendly atmosphere although i only ordered iced coffee  the waitress brought over a generous heaping of free tapas  a spread that included olives  bruschetta  and garlic  and never was i under any pressure to vacate my table the dj kept the vibe going spinning downtempo hiphop ill definitely be back for drinks when i dont have to work
boy oh boy  were my taste buds in for a treat after being warmly greeted by the coownerhostessipoddj  we started with poached pears baked in raw honey with roquefort and drizzled with balsamic dressing and complemented by wine from nextdoor  byob and no corkage how deliciously affordable the other owner  her husband  stopped by our table to chat us up  he has managed nightclubs and restaurants in nyc for the better part of 15 years and is a charismatic whirlwind but back to the food  my friend went with the forest mushroom ragout stewed with tofu  carrots  spicy sprouts and caribbean beans  while i opted for free range chicken breast marinated in lime jus and jerk spices with chevre and papaya puree so tender  moist  and dripping with taste that sounded dirty  didnt it but im talking about some damn good cooking and the portions so generous even little miss piggy here couldnt finish her supper when it came to dessert however  this little piggy had none
before i found cheese n stuff  i ate top ramen then i told myself no  i will not have that stereotypical college ramen  so i started eating at chipotle yeah  im original you dont have to tell me but thank you anyways  well i was too much a stingy bastard for chipotle so i switched to 3 6inch sandwichs from subway  but deep inside  i was disappointed  like a chain smoker who switched to nicotene patches but one day  one glorious day  i saw a little sign that said cheese n stuff and i wondered wtf is stuff is it wine crackers koala bears well i went in and found out  stuff is cheap  delicious sandwiches made to order from a variety of breads  cheeses  meats  and toppings its also salads that i havent tried but all that matters are the sandwiches seriously  go get one now youre wasting too much time reading this shit
i love the sandwiches here  the honey oat bread is thick and so good  they are huge too  whenever i come to berkeley  i have to eat here conveniently located on telegraph where there is always a huge line out the door  they also have great salads  fresh tossed with fresh ingredients  sometimes they add too much dressing though good cheap prices especially for a starving student at cal  a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner
yum  i ordered the nacho boy from nacho boy  and it was nothing but pure unadulterated deliciousness  roast beef  avocado  shrooms and melted swiss cheese stuffed inside a sourdough roll and made dirty  you gotta get it dirty this is my new favorite sandwich  call in your order or wait a hour in line and another half hour for the sandwich  this ikes place is located inside the engineering building at stanford university  i have also been to the one in sf  this one is closer and just as good but parking was not ideal  metered visitor parking sucks man   i love sandwiches and i love ikes place
i cant comment on the food here but the ice cream is great  i tried the pistachio and it was a huge green scoop on a cake cone  everytime i go to palo alto  i try to make a trip here their ice cream is homemade and delicious  prices are really cheap too  this place is kind of hidden because its in a neighborhood and stands alone  cute old school diner type atmosphere  only open monday through fridays from 7am5pm
i wish there was a wegmans in northern california  this place has everything  i swear  there is a fresh bakery  ready to eat hot foods  pharmacy  fresh produce  video store  amazing meat and cheese selection  dry cleaners and a lot more  this place is like costco except you dont have to buy things in bulk  it is one of my favorite things about the east coast i could come here everyday and find something new to enjoy  prices are normal supermarket prices and food is insanely gourmet  it is also open 24 hours a day for those college students who get the midnight munchies i am counting the days till wegmans comes to california  i will be there with bells on
fresh cookies  soft or crispyyou decide  but either way they are delicious  this time i ordered the turtle and double chocolate chip with its a goody  i enjoyed it except for little bits of hardened toffee from the turtle cookie  but the cookie by itself is awesome  just not meant to be with ice cream unless you have strong teeth or like it really crunchy  its a good was so good    i also got the chocolate milk to go with my ice cream sandwich which was already filled with tons of chocolate  i think i oded on chocolate that dayi couldnt finish my chocolate milk  it was so good  but my body can only handle so much at once  but it was all worth it  im salivating right now just writing this review  ps cash only
ib hoagies was one of my favorite joints at cal  i still go to berkeley just for the curly cheese fries  cheese fries  anything they have cheese on lol  its a college town fast food joint filled with yummy deliciousness  the cheese is the creamy kind not the real melted cheese  its ooey goey cheese sauce that just makes everything taste so good  i prefer coming here over the cheese steak house when i crave for more veggies  i love the sliced lettuce  mayo  tomatoes  pickles  the works  i usually order the chicken philly and its always juicy  it lets me feel a little less guilty for gorging on an order of curly cheese fries on my own lol  i heart ib hoagies 
yay love this place they are open late they accept cash and credit card credit cards they charge a little extra though their portions are huge and their quick super close to cal  so after class i would just hop on over   service its a order and sit down place all the guys working there pretty friendly i never had a problem with it   food the food is awesome for the price  alfredo fettuccine with mushroom  loved it the pasta was al dente  which i loved because most fast place always over cook the pasta  cannoli  yummy it fixes my sugar craving  calzone  super huge but its worth it it can actually be split into two to share or to have for lunch and dinner good breadtoppings ratio   overall i would definitely recommend this place
fine dining  no  good  hearty americanized chinese food  yes  ive always had excellent food and service at china garden  the location next to schnucks is super convenient  easy to stop by on the way home or for a quick run on weekends  i almost always get mine to go  which must be the case for most of their business  food is cooked to order and is super fast about 10 min  portions are large i get two meals from a single order  unlike many chinese restaurants  the flavor of the food isnt overwhelmed by generic seasoning or msg  the egg drop soup the large is a quart has nursed me through many colds and its ridiculously cheap  i appreciate their vegetarian options and theyve always accommodated special requests  their vegetarian spring rolls are gigantic  its chinese fast food  but its fresh  tasty  and a bargain
the ribeye is the best for the greatest steak in town
thanks to big grove we have a fine dining establishment that bases their menu on fresh and local ingredients  i went there with my husband for our anniversary  but i can easily see going back for a more casual meal  or even for drinks and bar snacks    every table starts with slightly sweet popcorn and we were promptly visited by our friendly and helpful wait staff  we had the chicken liver pate  bistro filet  house made sausage  and the tater tots  everything we tasted was delicious  i cant wait to go back and work my way through the menu
definitely worth 5 stars  you wont get ambiance  but you will get amazing food
this cafe is wonderful  the atmosphere is bright and cheery  the coffee is wonderful especially the iced soy mocha  and the staff is always super courteous  there is a nice patio in back to enjoy outside seating and there is always great art on the walls
wonderful food and an amazing addition to our community
this is the real deal
i have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly i love trying new things and i am never disappointed  my dad has helped them with a batch of beer  they have made reeses vodka just for my mom and honestly  whenever i go with them to eat its like i walk onto the set of cheers everybody knows their name  but you dont have to be a regular to feel like youre getting special treatment i love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging i love the location  i love the feel i just wish i had more money so i could visit them more often
i really like this place for two reasons  1 the restaurant  bar remind me of legitirish bars that i went to in the nice areas of dublin  the bar and decor are perfect for creating an irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar    2  the food is great  they have a great brunch menu featuring legitirish breakfasts that are the same as the ones ive had in dublin  their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly
this place has great sushi  they have great monday night specials 1 pieces of sushi  3 sake which i love to take advantage of  i really love the big roll  the beef roll  and the dynamite roll  pheonix is an off the menu roll that you can order which comes out on a plate set on fire  mixed drinks are really good there too
two words to describe this joint outstanding bbq  if you eat meat  this is a place you have to try  great ribs  great pork  great brisket  the wait is always really long to get a table cause the food is fantastic  but the space is a bit small for the demand
this place is tiny  which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door  but dont be dissuaded everything ive tried has been fresh and flavorful  and absolutely not drowning in grease which is often my complaint when it comes to mexican food  particularly in the midwest my current favorites are the guacamole  veggie chalupas  and pumpkin flower quesadillla im slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as i return and return again  snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections yum  lately ive been calling for takeout more often because the logistics of getting to maize and finding space are not always easy and so i would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike  car parking bike rack  please but that doesnt seem to be worth knocking off a star  and other than that  i wouldnt want them to change anything
im a mostlyveggie eater  and i love this place their portabello sandwich is among the best ive ever had  apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully the catfish is also delicious love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides i highly recommend the sweet potato fries and  if its summer  the smoked sweet corn yum as most everyone else has said  the meats are also delicious  according to my husband and the tons of people weve brought here for lunch or dinner  their tap list is relatively small  they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time  but theres always lovely choices recently  theres been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin  apple fall beers bar and food service sometimes seems rushed  but surprisingly good for how busy they get  this place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours 30min wait at 830pm on a wednesday  but it has still become our default for outoftown guests that says a whole heck of a lot
best breakfast in cu  the courier breakfast is fantastic  especially with the sausage links  which are essentially english bangers  delicious  when anyone visits town  i make a point to take them to courier because it is such a good representation of what cu has to offer  the coffee selection is almost always great  and service is typically delightful
my friend and i celebrated his birthday here last night and the experience was perfect we were initially given a table very close to a party of four  but they quickly moved us to another table at our request the wine list was pretty broad and we enjoyed a bottle of aligot  a light white wine the bread  which features a different herb daily  was delicious with the butter sweetened with honey the mac  cheese appetizer was excellent  but the risotto was a little salty the butternut squash soup with crme frache was great while the idaho rainbow trout was prepared without much fanfare  it was a welcome change to such places like salt of the earth which drowns many of its dishes in an overabundance of disparate ingredients finally  the milk chocolate pot de crme was pure bliss it wasnt too sweet and perfect for two people to share the wait staff was pleasant and wellinformed i look forward to returning to toast in the near future
awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options the meatloaf  which is currently standard  was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty the dessert  the girl scout trio consisting of their take on samoas  tagalongs  and thin mints  was  well  orgasmic the waitress  roxanne  whom i told did not have to put on her red dress  was sweet and not overly attentive oh  and its byob i will definitely be back
just incredible pastries  the breads obviously have an amazing amount of attention paid to them  and it pays off with the most flavorful and fulfilling bites  was in boston for just a weekend and had to come back the second day after falling in love with the sticky buns on the first day  sticky buns  bread on the breakfast sandwiches  cookies  yum
had an amazing  friendly  quiet  cozy  fresh dinner here  very much looking forward to coming again but after going once ill say its one of the best places ive been in pittsburgh  daily menu is limited and written on a chalk board above the dining room  looking forward to getting to know this place  byob is a plus servers are friendly and attentive
a decent ramen joint in university city and they have vegan ramen with vegan broth im sold  since ive been a vegetarian my entire life  ive always been envious of all my friends who get to slurp down ramen its been one of my biggest foodie dreams to finally have a bowl of ramen someday  and ramen bar has provided me with that  my 4 friends and i decided to go to ramen bar on a thursday night around 730pm it was packed fortunately  though  we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated at the clean  wooden tables a notable feature abour ramen bar is the open kitchen you pass by  where you can see everything the chefs are doing you can see that theyre actually making everything from scratch  in a very clean setting  so thats reassuring  since the restaurant is so new  the waitstaff are a bit flustered  but theyre extremely friendly and willing to do anything to accomodate the guests when we were ordering  my friend and i both ordered veggie ramen  and she made sure to ask if we wanted the vegetarian broth with traces of pork or have freshly made vegan broth at no additional charge awesome she also gave our table great recommendations on toppings  and our water was filled fairly regularly  it took about 20 minutes for our ramen to come out  which was impressive for how crowded the restaurant was i ordered a veggie shoyu ramen with curly noodles and was extremely impressed by the beautiful presentation and aroma of the dish the taste was even better obviously  i am no ramen snob  and have nothing to compare this ramen to  but aaaahhh finally having veg ramen for the first time in my life to me  the dish was excellent the addition of sriracha just made it better all of my friends were really impressed as well  and we had quite a jovial time i tried my friends veggie miso ramen with straight noodles  and it was amazing too  the only downside was that my friend ordered a 2nd order of noodles 2  but they didnt come in time  since theyre prepared from scratch however  the kind waitress packed it togo for him  as well as gave him more complimentary broth  which was appreciated also  8 to 12 for a bowl of ramen is steep  but not steep enough to keep me away from coming back every time my wallet can afford it  moral of the story im not sure how good this ramen is for omnivorous ramen snobs  but if youre a vegetarianvegan dying to finally try ramen  this is the place
sniff  i cant believe this day has actually come  rip buck fiddy  you will be missed
four stars for the food one star as a tip to the cook for never once wincing at the ready to erupt volcano of food in my bowl before it gets plopped on the grill  score two full days of food to add to the freshman fifteen   this place still holds a dear spot in my heart simply because it helped me feed my way through college the perfect meal was a night at mongols with a platter of meat  veggies  carbs  and lots of them not to mention glorious sauces glistening down my chin as i shoveled noodles into my gaping jaw keep going until youre full up to your chin  take the rest home and repeat in 24 hours thats the only way to do it  kids   i will still happily return to mongols at a moments notice i probably dont need to be as hasty with the volcanobowl save some for the hungry college kids cause im generous and all  but i will need a bib

enzos is probably the best pizza ive ever had they are open til really late on the weekends perfect for a 2am meal  and much better than taco bell which is across the street it has an italian mafia theme to it with pictures of frank sinatra and scenes from the godfather hanging on the walls not only do they have the best pizza in westwood  but they also have the biggest one time i ordered a massive 23 inch pizza that thing was a monster  enzos gets 5 stars for having the best pizza  prices  service  and ambience i recommend it to anyone in the westwood area who is hungry at 2am
rip fake sub we call it fake sub cuz it was like subway  but fake lol  so many memories at this place  sad to see you go 
i love going to the backyard its just perfect for a sunday afternoon the backyard burger is one of my favorite burgers in la this place is a little pricey but totally worth it you can sit by the pool and relax with some good food  great drinks  and sometimes they play house music i wish they would lower the prices a bit then it would be perfect

oh  mr luthe mystery of how yummy one burger can be is easily answered at this bright orange  funky decorated establishment  i have tried several of the burgers and never been disappointed among my favorite are bbq  blu cheese  and cajun i like to order the veggie with the cajun sauce its a bit spicy but a great addition to a burger that would be bland  the man who i always see there i am going to assume is mr lu   is always more than kind and friendly prices are reasonable  bit more than fast food  but much fresher also  with a punch card its pretty easy to acquire a free burger the fries are perfectly seasoned and flavorful  the fry sauce is a must  by the end of the meal 2 containers can easily be dominated by one person   hours are decent as well  i think theyre open until 10 or 11 on weekdays  take the walk across the street from jack in the box or memos  you will be delightfully surprised
ok  you guys i love waffles i love sandwiches  so what coule be better than a  waffle sandwich oh yeah  pretty much nothing  madeleines serves a sandwich made with a fluffy waffle for bread it had an overmedium egg  ham  and a yummy tangy sauce that blended the sweetness of the waffle and the savory of the ham perfectly also noteworthy  it was made to order and hot when served  my boyfriend ordered the breakfast panini  which i snagged a bite of and it was very flavorful it had an egg  bacon  pickles  and another flavorful sauce it too was made to order and was hot and crispy  not at all greasy or soggy  both of us were very pleased and completely finished our sandwiches the staff were very welcoming and quick to prepare our food and coffee on another occasion  ive had one of their sweet cream filled pastries  and it was very light and airy  sweet and pretty cheap i think one dollar  all in all  i will definitely be back to this cute place
absolutely the best place to have an asian style lunch free wifi and good music the owner likes classical music i like it too   their food  oh my god  check my pictures out chicken katsu don  shrimp tempura don  curry chicken rice bow all around 8 bucks and comes with purple rice i just love it  this place is super worthy to dine in   updated 080812 recent review by yelp user chris j about they dont make their own bakery is a false statement  they make their bakery i witness it every single day try their twicebaked almond croissant then tell me your comments again  to chris  reviews can easily harm lots of considerate  hardtrying small businesses please review with truth  not guesses or conjectures
oh my god this is the best place to have breakfast sick of starbucks slow service on 42nd come here im sick of lining at starbucks every morning i think you are too  if you are a husky   come here i think you will be satisfied
jesus  i love this place   if you havent had it try the dagwood roast beef  ham  turkey all cooked up on a flat iron grille and stuffed in a pita with fresh veggies what in the hell is not to like people have you checked out the nutrition facts on this place its healthier than subway for christ sake   360 calories for my favorite pita that fills me all the way up till the next meal all the complaints about this place are bullsheet you dont like it then you shouldnt be in the u dist crack heads  hookers  whores  bums  reeeaaallll chhhhaaannnggeeee  it all comes with the territory   i love the pita pit i might franchise one of these
also very sad about the closing of this place i had been coming here since 2000  which my gf  now my wife we were driving through the u dist and were hungary and decided to stop in to relive our college days with some of the best teriyaki in seattle to our display the place has changed names  owners  decors  and menu we ordered anywaybig mistake the food was a huge downgrade the place that is there now is called thunder burger  teriyaki i should have known better i will be giving the thunder burger its own review rip kyoto teriyaki  you will be missed
awesome possum assortment of fresh fruits  veggies  meats  cheese  herbs  and more  last time i was there the poppies were poppin with colors to die for  carrboro has such a cool vibe and its great to support local farmers  as a former fruitstand worker with family who owns a blueberry farm in michigan i had high standards  this is definitely worth a weekly trip
med deli  mad deliciousness  their selection and flavorful dishes are to die for  i send any visitors looking for a great spot there  at work we cater a good 90 of our meals with them as its always a big hit among college kids
vimala cooks  everybody eats  fresh  locally sourced food with a commitment to food justice and workers justice what could be better than that well  the food is really really tasty  i went for lunch  which meant no wait  as they just started their lunch service so quick  run over for lunch now before everyone finds out and it becomes as popular as their dinner service  i had the chole batura plate it was delicious  in addition to the yeasty batura bread and the chickpea chole  there was some kind of yummy slaw hiding under some chopped tomatos that was holding all these complex flavors  the dish was pretty good  then i tried the slaw  and it made it perfect  vimala came out a few times to ask how everything was  offer me some chutneys  and a second helping of the yummy batura  the lunch prices  though not cheap  are certainly reasonable given that the food is coming straight from local farms    there are tons of vegetarian options on the menu  vimala and her crew are very friendly  the prices are decent  the philosophy behind the food is one i can get behind  and the food itself is super tasty  this may be my new favorite place to eat in the triangle
jack sprat is   1 a good restaurant as far as food goes i recommend the soups yummm as well as the santa fe wrap  2 a good coffee shop the coffee is good  atmosphere during the day can be studious but not overly quiet  and plugs are available for those with lap tops  3 a good bar there is often live music and generally a good crowd with good vibes here   overall i highly recommend this place
just to repeat what so many people here have said best veggie burger in the triangle its amazing homemade goodness i usually get mine with goat cheese  caramelized onions  lettuce  tomato the fries are delicious  but come in huge portions i recommend splitting them with a friend it wont save you all that much money since they have a combo deal  but it will save substantially on wasted food yum the staff are also really nice  and the dipping sauces are delicious   i really miss living near buns  when i crave a veggie burger and fries buns is what i want
i love this place its just so cute the building itself is unique  and its overall a very nice place for lunch or dinner with friends  as well as a nice place for a date more importantly  the food is awesome and the service is consistently good they have a wide array of both vegetarian and meat dishes everything ive gotten here and ive been a lot of times has be top notch delicious comfort food my personal favorite are the blackeyed pea cakes theyre amazing
prior to last night  the last time id eaten at elaines was november 2007  not a reflection on elaines at all  but there was always something newer i wanted to try  piedmont  rue cler  watts  etc  those are all good restaurants  but in the fogginess of the last few years  somehow i ended up thinking that they were as good as elaines  i was wrong  elaines laid down the fucking law last night  i had the heirloom tomato sampler and the kurobuta pork chop and was in heaven from the first bite  heirloom tomatoes came with a salt sampler that was a little gimmicky maybe only because my taste buds are dead from years of smoke and liquor  but still delicious  pork chop and aioli were so good  the wife ate half ah marriage  only weak spot in the whole thing was dessert  i thought the mint ice cream sandwiches were decent  but nothing special  the rest of the meal was so good i cant bring myself to take an entire star off though  with durham getting the lions share of the food hype recently  its good to know there are places like elaines holding it down for chcarrboro  no chance im waiting another 2 years to go back
finally  franklin street gets a restaurant that doesnt serve burritos or subs this place has great burgers and great fries their many dipping sauces are top notch too try the curry  youll love it my gf and i noticved that they serve brand x ketchup  so youll want to use the dippiong sauces instead this place is cheap  delicious  open late  and filling all of the makings of a great franklin st spot lets hope it lasts
most amazing bar in the area they do everything perfectly  wine  beer  cocktails  cheese  charcuterie   chocolate they also have the best bartenders around listen to their suggestions go you wont regret it
one of the best greek salads ive ever had all the greens  veggies were fresh  the grilled chicken was tender  juicy  and the dressing was not overwhelming and oily  im not a bread fan  but they serve warm homemade pita bread with the salad  definitely a good deal for the price my boyfriend enjoyed his gyro as well  in addition to tasty food  they have outdoor seating  which creates the perfect dining out experience
panzanella is becoming another staple restaurant for my boyfriend and me they have an amazing outdoor patio that has a casual  romantic feel their wine list is good without being overly expensive they also have seasonal cocktails that are made from local fruits which look really good  but i have yet to try one  when i go out to eat  i almost always get salads their salads are delicious and well worth the price they use fresh ingredients and all the tastes mesh well the first time i ordered the arugula salad with beets  goat cheese  and spiced pecans perfect the next time we went was during their special seafood dinner i got the poached seafood salad also good  but the arugula salad still wins  if youre not a salad person  my boyfriend has ordered the italian sausage pizza and loved it each time  on a service note  the second time when i went  the waitress forgotdidnt hear me request dressing on the side i hate being an annoying patron and sending a dish back  but she sensed it and immediately asked what she could do she returned with a new salad and with a choice of dressings on the side how sweet   great outdoor seating  great food  great service  great drinks  and to top it off  they focus on using local ingredients what more could you want 
yum yum worth every bite you can sample any flavor and add any toppings you would like  you pay by the ounce choose this over balis  tastes fresher and is cleaner
jaffa or petra petra or jaffa how do you choose  where do you go since they are right next door to one another   its like choosing between right or left and is all based on preference or any bias you have regarding one or the other   i really dont know the back story of why these two places are split  or whatever dramatic thing that seemed to have happened  i just try to base my opinions on the quality of food and customer service  anywayi first went to petra as it always seems there are more people in there maybe because its smaller and looks busier  or all the neon beer signs they make 5 star pizza  and a good falafel pita   however  i recently went to jaffa and i cant speak in terms of the meat products from either placebut the falafel and the pita here were hands down the best i have had  jaffa has won multiple best of slo for a reason   pros jaffa has excellent and authentic food affordable for quantity  very friendly staff clean restaurant wonderful sauces outstanding baklava for only 100 if its your first time its free  cons styrofoam cupstogo wear bums me out   5 stars  will be returning
just went for brunch today based on a friends recommendation  superb  inventive  delicious selections  i had the go green  a scramble with a homemade basil pesto and perfectly marinated mushrooms  topped with fried green tomatoes and fresh mozzarella  got a side of cheese grits that were about as accurate as it gets  the food is fresh  interesting  and yummy  and the coffees not bad  the atmosphere is hipster as hell but the waitstaff is friendly rather than surly  definitely a cozy place for the lgbtq crowd the disco brunch will feel a little like an evening at the midway but not too crunchygranola    please note the service was a little sloppy this morning but  these guys opened less than 48 hours ago  if you go in the next few weeks  be patient in terms of service since theyre a brand new businesstheyre still getting their feet wet  the food is definitely worth a little wait or scatterbrainedness  and i have no doubt things will be running ship shape in no time
damn  green street  you treat me so right  food  consistently phenomenal  cocktails  solid takes on the classics  atmosphere  lively and cozy  you would never even know this place is here because its literally across the street from where the 70 bus picks up and unobtrusively tucked away    what you get is reasonably priced 5star cocktails  a respectable beer list  and a great menu of new americaneclectic dishes  not as harsh a blow to your wallet as cuchi cuchi  not as jampacked as central kitchen  not one of the sketchy bars you normally frequent in this area    if youre in central  go here
i never visited stams when it was on the north side of chapel hill  but boy do i visit them now    just walking into the store is a treat for the senses  the chocolatepeanut butter gelato is worth a trip alone  their creamy caramel chocolates just melt in your mouth  bob droog and staff are some of the nicest  friendliest people ive met in a retail setting  i met a friend for coffee the other day and amy  a staff member brought it over to us  we visited  drank our coffee and left the next day i rememberedoh my goodness  we didnt pay for the coffee  i drove back over and there was bob  the owner  behind the counter  i told him we had not paid for our coffee the previous day and he just smiled as i handed him the money saying something likethose things can happen  can you imagine someone saying that to you anywhere else in chapel hill  stams is a chapel hill treasure  and if you have not visited the store at 54 east please do  youll be glad you did
love alfredos pizza and think  it is the best in the area  we always get great service either when eating in or using delivery if you want more char on your pizza just ask for well done  they are happy to accommodate  this pizza also reheats beautifully   i highly rocco end alfredos
thin crust  delicious ingredients  friendly people the tomato sauce and pepperoni in particular are out of this world  the only downside is the price  but if not for that id be eating this pizza every single daywhich my body cant sustain also  at other places margherita pizza mozzerella cheese  sauce  and basil is extra  while here its their standard  so you really have to readjust your thinking there  this is far and away my favorite pizza place in the whole world lucky me i live and work minutes away
i went here for dinner yesterday  for the first time in years why should i have i can get great indian food at my parents house in plainsboro  i have to say  lesson learned the interior is beautiful  the food was wonderful  and the service was good it was sunday night and pouring  which might account for why it was almost empty  but just in case im writing this review the owners are very very friendly and communityminded  we got dosas  puris  chicken shahi korma  raita  mango lassi  and the star goan fish curry with flounder it was definitely far too much food for two  and we didnt expect one order of puri to be so large the two curries were delicious  hot  and fresh the raita and lassi were authentic and refreshing the dosas were thin and crisp on the outside  soft on the inside  and came with sambar and a great coconut chutney everything came in beautiful dishes  which just enhanced the whole experience it had the look and feel of a much more expensive place  i wanted to try almost everything on the menu we also ended up with no room for dessert i guess its ok because well absolutely come back next week in the meantime there are leftovers in the fridge that i cant wait to tackle  finally despite the lovely atmosphere  it might not be the best choice as a date place we were far too busy eating to do any talking
my favorite ice cream place unique incredible flavors and textures carrot cake ice cream that has a feeling cant quite put my finger on it of actual cake  while remaining wholly ice cream fragrant pink rose and chocolate rose unbelievable youhavetotryit olive oil  which they sprinkle a bit of sea salt on peanut butter oh  glorious peanut butter and local flavors triumph beer  nj cornetc can i get a jersey tomato  and if that werent enough  the hot chocolate is out of this world  particularly the habanero hot chocolate its not a seasonal thingi will go for ice cream in winter and hot chocolate in summer bonus the cup covers are pretty nifty  ok  my wallet cant really handle it on a daily basis but weekly  yes portionwise  i used to be able to eat a pint of bj 7 years ago  and still have a huge appetite for sweets  but the serving sizes here are strangely satisfying though theyre so small maybe because the tastes are so rich  um  and  dont bother with the cupcakes or at least  i dont
best anywhere
always good no matter what you order love the onion blossom
monday lunch  1230 wasnt too crowded large menu with a good selection sides like sweet potato fries spicy potato salad were both good  great sandwiches at reasonable price very good beer selection and offer a beer flight of current on tap look forward to an evening meal to try the entree menu
fiesta cafe has the best mexican in champaignurbana everything isnt made with the same ground beef  there are choices ordered a beef taco and had 4 choices of beef from ground to a chipotle marinade on a nice night  outdoor seating is fun great mexican beer selection and drink specials occur
cant argue with anything anyone else has said   watch out for google latitude directions  you end up catty corner from where your suppose to be   the chrizo nacho cheese was fantastic
the best restaurant in the area hands down i travel all  and have a job which takes me out with clients often finally clairemont has a place which rivals other places in areas like pasadena  downtown  the oc or the westside  interesting menu  the waygu beef is awesome this place is good for brunch as wellfor those who dont like it the prices yeah its not cheap  if you want  cheap and predictable  try all the bland chain restaurants near the mall
the best of all the restaurants  my fav loved it huge portions  tasty lovely  the waiters were great  the food was tasty  cheap i paid around  21 plus 5 for the waitress we had  who was nice this was the second time we went there i had a greek dish the first time the second time i had a greek omelete breakfast plus french toast i loved the food would definitely go there againyummy
yes value for money and the food was tastyyyits a mixture of american and continental food  i had  shrimp salad and a sandwich  huge portion and cheap nice ambience  waiter was moody  but the food made up for it and the portion was huge  huge  huge paid around 25 including tip  will definitely go there againyummy
bella pita is awesome  i usually order the bruin combo which includes a falafel pita  fries and a drink  all three items come for about 78 bucks which is a good deal nowadays  the pita is great because of the customization ability with the vegetable bar  the fries are okay  nothing special but also nothing horrible  i try to stay away from soda but when a place offers coke cola made by real cane sugar  i just have to have it   first time i went here the owner was taking the orders and he made the place feel very welcoming   overall a 5 star place for the great food  nice people and the sugar cane coke  ill probably get my order delivered next time
this place has been around seemingly forever and little has changed  i hope it always endures that way  hawaiian food thats pretty great  portioned for islander appetites  and priced for college students  what more could you ask for  the picture menu on the wall has not changed much since i was hanging around the ave as a student at uw  the choices are plentiful and the staff has always been friendly  im surprised i didnt review this place before because i still recommend it to friends  dont forget that its cash only  or you might be forced to use the atm in the shop and i dont know what that thing charges  but i bet its closer to something than nothing  always great
the cedars restaurant has always been my goto place for indian in seattle  its been at the top of my indian list for years and i love the place  i do love the food here immensely  the butter chicken is fantastic  the nan is usually quite a portion and we always order a couple  plain and garlic  my fave dish  though  is the coconut curry with chicken  yumo  the chai here is also pretty freakin fantastic and theyll keep filling it for you all night long unless its a packed house  i love the baklava that they bring out with the bill  this place is a good place for a casual  yet still nice date or for groups  on the unfortunate side  when it is packed is a terrible time to go  i mean terrible  its not that the food goes down in quality  but you can be sitting around waiting for more service for a long time  its understandable and it can get ridiculously busy  especially on a friday evening  but it can be aggrevating if you arent interested in waiting for the food  i always think its worth the wait  but still try to avoid rush hour  unfortunately  theyve missed the baklava that used to always be brought out with the bill a couple of times in the more recent history  unfortunate especially because its a great ending  we just had to order it then  lastly  and also quite unfortunate  is the parking situation  ever since that walgreens moved in next to it  the cedars parking has been pushed across the street to safeways lot and there is little available parking there  if youre lucky youll find a spot in there or right on brooklyn  but if youre smart youll walk or bus over
howzit  its awesome  thats how it is  i had never heard of pams until i read about it from nina n i love food from the west indies and pams is somewhere that will make me forgo many of the other locations in seattleits really that good  i had lamb roti potatoes and lamb  spiced  curried  and put into a piece of rotithink tortilla  but more pliable  and quite a bit tastier served on the side was a cabbage  not shredded lettuce  salad to drink  i had some rum punchmmmm mmmmmi think it was spiced with ginger and to top it off  i was asked if i wanted some hot sauce feeling saucy  i accepted  good lord their hot sauce is hot its habenero mixed with something its got the consistency of applesauce  its dully yellow in color and its hotter than the coals found in hell  or at least thats where they found this stuff be cautioustalk about kicking it up a notchit kicked my arse up a couple of floors  the service and atmosphere nicely accompany the decadent cuisine here as trinidadiantoboggan music bumps  youll be catered to by the attentive staff  do i recommend pams do you like all your toes
best pupusas ever well  at least this side of the border guanacos serves absolutely authentic salvadoran cuisine  the pupusas especially the veggie and the pork tacos being my favorites pretty much everything here is amazing even just the rice and beans just have a little something special in them plus  this is the kind of local business that seattleites need to support the owner is officially one of the nicest guys ever and always greets me and my company warmly oh  yes  the prices are great as well it doesnt look fancy from the outside  or the inside for that matter  but the food is fabulous and by far surpasses the pretensions of somewhere like la isla not that i am not a fan just too expensive to frequent i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i love the pupusas i swear if i have anything to do with it  they are going to be the next big seattle food craze  as long  of course  as business is still booming here  its all good the guac i am not so fond of  but hey  where else can you get a side of guac for 75 cents no where  thats where love guanacos  support guanacos perhaps someday ill be granted the masa dough recipe gooooooooooooaaaaaallllllll
edit i love hoppy beers now took me long enough big time gets a big time upgrade from 4 to 5  now that i realize each and every one of their brews is gold   so its a saturday night  and you find yourself on the ave at a bar so crowded that it takes 5 minutes to get a drink  and when you finally get to the bartender  you have to shout at them over the blaring top 40 music just so they can hear your order you think  what the fuck am i doing here i just want to enjoy a few beers with some friends that i can actually talk to without shouting at then you suddenly remember that brewpub down the street in the quaint little brick building  and you realize that all hope is not lost   on any given night  there will usually be a few tables open where one can enjoy good beer  good food  and have a good conversation with good music pearl jam  pixies  ccr  etc playing at a decent level in the background   im pretty much in love with their sandwiches particularly the cascade and pink cadillac also to be had are very tasty pizza slices  chili  and most everything else on the menu   as for the alcohol  theres only beer lots and lots of craftbrewed beer  which thankfully drives away the i just wanna dance and drink vodkaredbulls crowd im not a huge fan of ipas  or really hoppy beers in general which several of their brews are however  they do have an excellent porter and a delicious brown ale   looking for bud light mixed drinks a dance floor loud pop music trendy and hip decor thankfully  you wont find any of that here
jumbo lamb and beef gyro for 5 really  this is all that matters ive been here for lunch  dinner  and most frequently at 1 am after leaving big time or finn mccools no matter what time of day  the service is always fast and the gyros are always delicious and filling cash only shouldnt be a problem  as there are both wells fargo and boa atms within a block and a half of this place
im hooked with this place one of the best gyro i have had cash only and they open late i always get the 9 jumbo highly recommended
my favorite dish is the alpha sig plate chicken katsu  spicy chicken  egg  fried rice  throw in a lil extra for the spam masubi
good food  good beer
my coworkers recommended this place to me and then i saw it on man vs food i came here thinking it was just a tourist trap and was pleased to know that it has great food the sweet potatoes fries are great and the burgers will stretch your imagination and satisfy your taste buds   everything i have had here is terrific i have had zuccini fries  potato fries  sweet potato fries  tater tots  and every burger is just delicious try the black velvet if you are in the mood for a deliciously smooth beer
food the pizzas are as good as everyone says they are dough is light  crunchy  chewy the perfect trifecta toppings are fresh and in perfect proportion to the pizza im getting hungry again just writing this review  value a bit pricey for pizza  but its totally worth the price of admission a pizza should easily feed two normal sized humans so 20ish for a meal for two is really quite a bargain  ambiance if you get there right before it opens  youll likely encounter a line no worries  the orders are taken when you walk in and pizzas take about 3 minutes to cook in those beautiful brick ovens sitting in the communal kitchen area is fun and probably the best seat in the house   service very good  recommended for any true pizza lover and everyone else too
after a long day of walking through the parks and browsing the houston museum of natural science  my and the man were ready for some food so glad that yelp brought me here i ordered the fish tacos everyone raved about  and it was worth it they were no doubt the best fish tacos ive ever had amazing fresh flavor  fish perfectly cooked and huge slices of avocado yum the rice and beans also had great flavor and i gobbled everything up the man had madetoorder quesadillas with the avocado bacon ranch  and those were really great as well love it the balanced great flavors had me wanting more i need a reason to go back
the reputation of luckies proceeds itself by far  everyone kept telling me that i would like this club  i would respond with a long  exaggerated eye roll  my standards are extremely high for clubs  my friend was having one of her 30th birthday parties here    luckies did not disappoint  i had a really good time from the moment i stepped into this club until i left  this has quickly risen to the top of must visit places in atlanta  i hate to sound cliche but if youre looking for a classy  sophisticated adult crowdthis is your place  my sister and her friends ordered food and it was so good  what i didnt tastelooked good    the decor reminded me of a few vegas lounges we went to  very upscale  modern and chic  the dance floor was packed and the music was good  our party was upstairs in vip which is a pretty nice layout  there are secluded sitting areas open to the air which is pretty sweet  if you ask me    luckies gave me everything i needed  fine men that actually buy drinks without stalking afterwards  good bartenders  good music and cool people  i will be coming backluckies is on my list of things to do    loved it
we stumbled upon this place after being at the worst club in the entire city of atlantathe verve  and decided to eat here at 1am  since the night was still early  this place had the biggest pieces of chicken on the face of the damn earth  eating here was the highlight of my entire trip  our waiter was to worried about broads to give us good service  i firmly believe gladys night would not approve  beyond thati had a good t ime and felt really comfortable here    you must go here
their phone number is easy to remember 404 tralala and they usually have a student special  i think the one now is 999 for a 3 topping large
my parents were visiting over the holidays and we decided to give this place a try after hearing good things about it from some chinese friends  the decor is okay  not too shabby or overly ornate  but the bathrooms were very clean  we ordered from the chinese menu and tried crab and fish maw soup  twice cooked pork and squirrel fish  along with hot green tea and rice  the soup was the least impressive of the three  it was rather bland  had only a tiny bit of crab meat and consisted mostly of egg white drops and this styrofoam textured thing that had no taste fish maw  but it was nice and warm  which hit the spot after a chilly long walk from the unc campus    next  the twice cooked pork came out and it was every bit as authentic as it should be  it was spicy enough to make you want to gulp down rice  but not so spicy that it would turn your appetite off  i usually dont like spicy foods  but i enjoyed this dish very much    the squirrel fish came out last and it was a large fried tilapia  with the bones removed  but the head and tail intact  it was served on a bed of shredded carrots  glazed with a sweet and sour sauce and garnished with pine nuts  peas and carrots  i liked it because im a sucker for anything fried and covered in sweet and sour  but my parents said it was a bit overcooked  but we still enjoyed it nevertheless    the bill came out to about 40 for the three dishes  the fish being the most expensive at 18  overall  i liked this place and the offerings are quite authentic as far as chinese food goes
i tried this place last week and it was pretty awesome  after circling the small parking lot fruitlessly  i ended up parking on the street  the mcdonalds next door is supposedly pretty towing happy  so i wasnt going to tempt fate by parking in their spots    i ordered their special of the day  which was a panini with italian ham and prosciutto with provolone and some yummy veggies inside  i also got an order of their homemade potato chips  omg  those chips were to die for  greasy  but oh so tasty with little bits of herbs and salt on top  i ate the whole thing  the sandwich was warm  gooey and delicious  the amount of filling was enough  but not exactly stacked  it also came with a little side of carrot salad which i enjoyed as well   overall  i liked this place and will return to try their other sandwiches
ive been eating at 35 at least once a month since i moved to chapel hill five years ago  dont go there if you are expecting exotic or authentic chinese food  because their offerings are very americanized  but if you have a palate like my little brothers  who considers panda express to be the definition of great chinese food  you will love this place  my favorite items on the buffet are pan fried dumplings  these are juicy  tasty and totally awesome  i usually load up my plate with them if they have just been refreshed by the kitchen staff  my second favorite dish is the eggplant dish  it doesnt look like much  but try it if you like eggplants  i love that stuff  it tastes just like my grandmothers  i also like the salt and pepper shrimp  though it takes a bit of work to peel them  theres a good variety  ranging from the typical orangesesamesweet  sour chicken  broccoli beef to fried salmon and steamed flounder  they also have a variety of little steamed chinese dim sum  theres a nice fresh fruit and dessert section  with a candy bar for your soft serve ice cream  i also like their egg drop soup  which they bring out to you with your drink order    overall  i love this place and will continue to go there on a regular basis as long as i live in chapel hill  its not pf chang  so dont go there expecting that sort of service  but it is a great chinese buffet in a college town that will fill belly for a very reasonable price
ridiculously positive and plentiful reviews for a reason fresh  fast  delicious and reasonably priced some of the best falafel  if not the best ive ever had
i come here mainly for the veggie delight and whenever i feel guilty from eating too much junk food over the days the food here is extremely healthy trust me i know since i was briefly obsessed with nutritionfitness for a period of my life the amount of salad you get is obscenely large  a good deal for the price and i swear to god that i just feel better after eating their food you almost always have portions left over so you can eat it for lunch the day after  which is awesome because it means you dont have to cook very important for a college student
one of the many reasons why i moved from nyc to oakland  this place is sublime at 2am  nights are judged as top dog nights or nontop dog nights    a top dog night is a night that lasts a lifetime or at least till the next weekend  favorites hot or a bird w chili  remember to be patient
its like the max and the peach pit for boalties damnit im outing myself
the vegetarian pad see ew wegg here is my favorite thai dish anywhere that it comes from a little momnpop getup makes it even better
best felafel i have had in long long time  possibly ever  and they have a little salad bar from which you pick your favorite garnishments for your sandwich loved that they also had eggplants my absolute favorite vegetable
after spending far too long in the doughnut deprived northeast please dont give me that nonsense about dunkin donuts tasting like anything better than cardboard  finding stans right down the street was like winning the lottery  first  the litmus test chocolatecovered old fashion  honestly  delicious  not as crispy on the outside as i like  but great chocolate and spot on softonthe inside doughnut  second  ohtheplacesyoullgo  ever dreamed of some ridiculous filling in a doughnut  they have it  blueberry oldfashionamazing  peanut butter and jelly doughnutheart attack of flavor  in short  if you want to become a diabetic  try this place  because one is just not enough and nowhere else around will do
this is a great store  went to college nearby  even though i live in north jersey now  im still a bottle club member  amazing selection and great prices  this is the only place you need to for beer  wine or liquor  i think theyre improved customer service and id checking  back in college they had guys at the front door  counter and exit  now they seem to operate like everybody else  iding as necessary but usually just the counter  give this place a try
im in love with teriyaki boy there i said it  ive been going here since college and it my absolute favorite bangforthebuck place  chicken teriyaki with spicy tuna roll and green tea  i dont even have to order it anymore  they remember  even though i only come in once every few months now i moved away but will go here whenever close  dont let the odd location fool you  this is the perfect lunch
uh  if you rated this place lower than five stars you are fucking crazy  its a warehouse a warehouse filled with booze all kinds of boozewine  liquor  beer  crazy shit ive never heard of  etc everything is cheap they have a gigantic selectionsee warehouse many employees to help you with your selection ive been here an embarrassing number of times  im really not sure what else you need in a liquor store
best place on earth i grew up in the area and ive eaten a number 1 with everything on it sometimes a number 3 with everything more times than you could possibly imagine interspersing these number 3s and 1s were many a cheeseburger  cheesesteak and sanchez forget that footlong horseshit you can get something thats at least two feet long here for around 5  its better than whatever sandwich place you go to except maybe georges
when it comes to sandwiches  im very  very simple simple like i only like my sandwiches with the bread and meat this place is perfect for people like me of course you can add more if you like  but if you prefer just two ingredients like me  they sure pack enough to make up for the other missing ones   very simple concept you go in  check off the items you want on a brown paper bag and hand it to the cashier this place is known for their bread never fails to be big  fluffy  and soft all at the same time definitely not able to find any other sandwich joint that has jalapeno cheddar bread like theirs   they pack their sandwiches with lots of meat so much that i really dont know how to start off the first bite half a sandwich is enough to fill me up i like to get the medium rare roasted beef on wheat bread with extra pickles and lettuce then stuff it with jalapeno kettle chips makes a perfect lunch d
we came here on a recommendation from our close friend who is an admitted food snob  i was told that the chicken parm was really good by the snob  and really i have not had an italian chicken dish that has compared  the chicken had a great crunch to it  but the meat was still incredibly tender  the sauce and pasta with it were amazing    i honestly cant fault this place for anything  the service was fantastic  the ambiance was great  if you want me to try to find a weakness it is in an area that is not convenient for me  and since i rarely pass by there i dont get to go back as often as i would like
this is my favorite beer bar in houston so far  its got a relaxed atmosphere and it isnt a scene  which is a plus in my book  if you like to enjoy a good selection of craft beers while chatting  this is the place to go  the outdoor patio allows you to hear your friends without having to ask them to yell  the location is also fantastic  being so close to rice campus and in a nice neighborhood where i havent had trouble finding street parking yet
ive been here several times and have yet to be disappointed  ive had several different sandwiches and salads and they were all fantastic  ive also heard wonderful things about their banh mi from people that i usually accuse of being banh mipho snobs  you order at a counter  but they bring your food to your table and bus your table for you  the big draw here is the quality of their ingredients  they use fresh  quality ingredients from local farms and i suspect that they bake their own bread  which is delicious  they have unique sides that are fresh  tasty  and possibly healthy how can raw vegetables have so much flavor  the service is also fantastic here    the food here is not cheap  but you get quality as well as quantity  i usually have leftovers  athough not quite enough for a full meal    the ambience of this place is delightful as well  lots of light  space  and modern decor  where you can see the food preparation taking place in a big open space  not only is the food good  but its extremely pleasant to eat here   i would caution about eating outside the tables are underneath a huge tree that offers great shade but many birds  and ive had pigeons poop into my salad
handsdown the best pizzeria in town  owned and run by an italian family better than dominos  papa johns and some of the other places  much better hole in the wall kind of place   but  the pizza and calzones are  very very good
i like this grocery store because the lady at cashier is very friendly   she always gives my son a little treat if hes with me  and when im not with him  asks about him  my son even played with her son once in a little back room while i was shopping  although i dont see her sons any more at the store  in any case  there is a lot of personal touch about the store thats totally missing in big supermarkets like tops or wegmans    she always have pure land buddhist chant on in the background  ever since she found out that my boy enjoys reading  she always gives him  different books about buddhism each time we visit them we are not religious but i like the fact that those books emphasizes filial piety hopefully they will help him better navigate tumultuous teenage years ahead shes known my son for about a decade  every time i take him there  she goes like  your boy is growing so big   im giving five stars because the lady is so nice its a totally enjoyable shopping experience  i go there usually to buy a big bag of kokuho rose ie rice  i am also a sucker for sesami balls  i think this is the only place you can get them in ithaca throw them in the oven and let them puff up and grow hot and chewy   such a wonderful treat   if you live in downtown or on west side of town  this is the closest asian grocery store i am too lazy to drive to triphammer mall to the other asian grocery stores
yummie  yummie  yummie in my tummy whenever im feeling really too lazy to cook i start looking around for somewhere to get some food from  i usually dont look much farther than this place they have really huge sandwiches  awesome desserts and if you order hummus it isnt just a dab  no they give you like a whole tub the best part thought they deliver coffee and they even use soy milk delivery speed is pretty good  and they dont have problems finding my apartment like some other places seem to  bonus
several of the other reviewers have stated that the landing is like two different pubs  one at night and the other the day  well its true that however  isnt a bad thing   during the day or very early morning this is the place to catch all the liverpool football games  and being a diehard lfc supporter its heaven most of the others in the pub during games will be lfc supporters  with the random groups of man u or arsenal supporters  but there isnt really any hostility towards the other groups  save for the off occasion here and there the food is pretty good  im pretty picky about food and what i dont like  so i love that i can order things however i want and i dont get crap for it the bartenders are all pretty nice and dont take forever with your orders even when the bar is packed   during the night all of the tables are pushed aside and the bar becomes a nightclub ive only been to thursday nights  which are the drum and bass nights theres loads of regulars who show up every week and are generally friendly the music can be very loud  so bring earplugs if youre sensitive like me   being from the phoenix area its fitting that this is the place i spend a lot of my time the landing is one of those random places i just cant seem to escape  and i dont really want to either
the chocolates are truly outstanding  forget about all the chocolates you had in the pasteven godiva  i never understood why people said chocolates are the next best thing to sexand now i understand   oh mywhat can i say  the chocolates melt in your mouth like buttah  and their hot chocolate yyyuuuummmmmyyyyliterally to die for  although im sadden by the thought of not having this chocolate store in la  i am so relievedotherwise  ill become diabetic in a month
this place is neat i just came in after a haircut across the way from supercuts big spender i know haha anyway cool place to hang out and the people there nice they even that a counter where you can hang out at which is always an awesome thing to have at a cafe i would love to come back here again nice ambiance and good coffee so come and try this place
an absolutely divine place in harvard square  enjoyed the decor  a bite of chocolate cake  and shared some house mint tea with peeps   definitely returning very soon  lovelovelovelovelove it
went here for their grand opening with my fiance and fell in love i love that cambridgeharvard square has a place thats dedicated to honey and everything that goes along with it not to mention their scrumptious honeylicious desserts that they served during their grand openingoh oh yum   they have honey from like all corners of the planetokay maybe thats an exaggeration  but they have honey from lotsa places  check it out
im rating the sandwhiches here i usually order an custom sandwhich  which is some variation of mortadella  capicola  proscuitto  tomatoes  and roasted peppers  all on a baguette all excellent the prosciutto really stands out and silky and salty  with the perfect consistency the bread is great as well the perfect italian sandwhich reminds me of my childhood  i might stop by to pick up some soppressata and cheese for home consumption to see how those are
brunch may be one of those american institutions that seems like it shouldnt be messed with  especially with staples like bacon and sausage forget the meat really veggie galaxy proves you dont need it to get the best brunch in the boston area   i had the eggs benedict  my standby when trying a new breakfast place veggie galaxy takes a unique approach  with herbed tomatoes  pickled onions  and chipotle hollandaise  with a large helping of outofthisworld homefries pun intended my boyfriend had the memorial drive omelet  which includes veggie chorizo so flavorful  you dont notice its made of soy we ended the meal with an amazing slice of vegan sweet potato carrot cake i will come back here my next time in boston
crema cafe gets 5 stars for the sweet potato sandwich alone it sounds like a strange combination of ingredients  cooked sweet potato  avocado  sprouts  green apple  and balsamic dressing but believe me  the flavors come together beautifully kudos to them for coming up with a unique vegetarian sandwich  the only downside is that theres a definite lunch rush and it can be hard to find seating
went to catalyst this past monday night for dinner with a friend the food wasincredible i want to go back immediately ill resist for a little bit  for the sake of my waistline  but seriouslyyum also  the space is pretty neat i dont know what the building was before  maybe a lab  but the high ceilings and industrial feel is pretty cool  it was a little funny  when we arrived and were seated  we had 2 different waiters approach us to ask if we wanted a drink  and tell us about the specials not sure if they were fighting over the table or something  but it was quickly resolved and we only saw one after that sadly  they were out of the crispy quail appetizer  something i had really hoped to try  as well as the candy roaster squash tortellini i guess i will have to go back for those i settled on the carmelized onion soup to start  and it was delicious really great texture and flavor  with the perfect amount of cheesy raclette toast in it my friend had the duck confit salad  and really liked it  it looked pretty delicious  for my main course  i had the tournedos of beef oh my god i hope they always keep that on the menu it was so good so so so good its 2 3oz filets  each on a bed of garlicky buttery swiss chard and parsley sauce  and topped with a taleggio ravioli there were just 2 raviolis  one for each tournedo  but that worked well the flavors were so incredible together i am not a fan of swiss chard  in general  but this was delicious and the parsley sauce  or whatever it was all on top of  was todiefor i really cannot wait to go back and have this again  which is a problem because i also want to try their chick pea fritters and their pastas and their chicken and and and and  my friend had the pork chops  and really liked that as well we shared a side of the drippings potatoes not quite as exciting as wed hoped with a name like that  i dont know  i envisioned buttery and dripping in an oniony fatty sauce or something but they were still tasty   for dessert  we shared the pear almond tart it was very different than what we expected  in terms of appearance  but it was really really tasty and the creme fraiche ice cream was a really neat accompaniment   in conclusion  it was delicious  and i want to go back again and again and again  to try more dishes and have the ones that i already had  again
wow  shocked to see so many poor reviews for thailand cafe   i used to get takeout from tc all the time when i was an undergrad at mit i judge dumplings from other places based on the tc dumplings  because they are just oh so good particularly love the sauces that they include i was recently in central square around dinner time  and picked up some tc and it was just as good as i rememberedand a short wait  ive always been more of an appetizer person  so i can attest to the meat steamed dumplings  spring rolls  and scallion pancakes all being quite excellent ive also tried their eggplant with garlic sauce  and i believe their chicken with green beans  and very much enjoyed both of them lo mein noodles are probably only soso  but the dumplings more than make up for that  definitely coming back here whenever im in central and craving dumplingsin fact  i think im going to order from the arlington location same owners tonight
i realize i have eaten here for dinner more than any other place in boston this past year  it suits me in that it is never crowded  the food comes out fast and it is always really tasty i am not a vegetarian  the first time i went  we thought the staff was really slow now we know that you gesture to the staff when you want them to come to the table  ah ha   i recommend the mango lassi  samosa  chicken korma and chicken masala  friends have tried the fish dishes and the tandoori and all were good
lps was opened in 1958  and is the oldest diner in harvard square the two brothers whip up terrific breakfast meals  sandwiches including their famous chicken breast sandwich 725   and homemade soups 190 for a cup if you want a simple classic try their grilled cheese and crispy fries leos place offers a true taste of cambridge  richie remembered my name from the only other time i went in and that was two years ago
last night i went to rialto with a couple of yelpers granted i have plenty of bizarre dietary restrictions no dairy  no meat  no fun however  i felt completely satisfied after my three course meal and my tab was 13 the cost it normally would be thank you restaurant week  i completely endorse the food and service at rialto my dining experience consisted of two bread baskets with gray sea salt and olive oil you know that really fresh cold pressed kind that taste a bit like grass a salad of dates  artichokes  toasted almonds was fresh and bright my main course of char icelandic salmon was paired nicely with a tingly mint and pea sauce then the glorious dessert toasted coconut semifreddo with chunks of gingered pear bitswas wonderful beyond belief   not sure there is anything in life better than good food companied by good friends
its a rainy boston day and i needed some nourishment and a steaming  cafe au lait crema cafe has a cozy atmosphere with large work tables long enough to hold students  writers  and families just as if you were in a german beer garden you sit together at this place this cafes close encounters has european sensibility of being able to connect people with their community while enjoying delicious food and drink   i opt for the quiche  freshly  made with ingredients like leeks  caramelized onions  and sometimes sweet potatoes when im in the mood for sweet i like the rosemary and goat cheese sandwich with honey  all and all this is probably my favorite new establishment in harvard square
never had a bad meal here  the wait staff is very helpful and knowledgeable when you have any questions  ive also eaten at the bar and enjoyed my time there as well  fun after work bar  too  i cant recommend this place enough  i dont think its particularly hard to find either  on green street  parallel to mass ave  behind the central square tstop  and they have hot salsa dancing on weekends  fun to just watch if you dont participate
i really do love this place  and i love having dinner at the bar  ive had sketchy service in the restaurant when its busy  but who hasnt  i dont hold that against them  love the eggplant  love all the tapas  loved it during restaurant week  and love all the fancy cocktails and the knowledgeable bar staff  one of my favorite places in the square
sometimes b wakes up  turns to me and says  i want pinkberry so  i roll over and oh me i realize that he is actually referring to the tangy  cool frozen yogurt product that we enjoyed in nyc   low and behold  yelp points me to berryline and all is well b rad and i hit up the cute little shoppe one fine evening and stood in the line that went out the door full of other peeps eager for a creamy probiotic confection    if you are not on your toes  the pressure can build when it is your turn to order and you havent quite decided what to get the toppings really need to be scoped out  unless you can read the sign up by the counter with the choices are you fruity or more of a candy ass tough call how about a combo  i wanted kiwi and chocolate no dice player  the young chapling at the counter said they were all out of chocochips the horror all fruity for me then i selected the original yogurt flavor with luscious kiwi and pineapple i like my fruit like i like my teenage boys  fresh and ripe oh and it was   they had other yogurt flavors  blueberry and cranberry that evening i was tempted by these choices  but the original tangy flavor compliments bold fruitiness so well   my b also chose original and selected reeses pieces and oreo i was so proud  the small size was perfecto and two overflowing topping choices hit the spot for i didnt have any dinner that evening tis okay if i dont have my required daily intake of sweetnessme go crazzzzzzzzy the prices are cheaper than the pinkberry and the quality to me was just as good  berryline is bradget approved  teee heeee awww precious
i cant get you out of my head mother i am hungry and i yearn for you   do you ever yearn  often  i sitand yearn i yearn to be in your warm womb with the muffled sounds of others enjoying your offerings  i yearn to taste your salty soft boiled peanuts  pressing the shell against my lips and popping them gently into my mouth i yearn for your french style gnocchi and the creative way you made my vegetarian soul warm with summer squashes and bright tomato kisses  instead of the suprisingly delicious mushrooms you provided me on my first visit  you are too good to me mother   i yearn for your sticky sweet butter lathered on the crunchy corn bread  i think about you too much i scan your menu page for new offerings you keep me on my toes  i have never felt this way before
this place rocked  my sloan friend took me here for saturday lunch  and it totally exceeded all my expectations  i loved how fluffy the crepes were  too often the crepes are too rich and oily  making you feel gross afterward  but the eiffel tower crepe was just perfect  with plenty of flavor  without overloading the crepe with too much cheese and oil  im not sure if ive had a better crepe  i wish stanford had a place like this right next to campus
only been once  but over a weekend of trying three highly rated independent coffee shops in boston  this was the best  very tasty espresso and perfectly crafted drinks  brownies look great  and it is cool that you can buy a half bar  though i havent tried it yet
i work in harvard square and eat lunch at veggie planet often enough that they know my name i recommend eating lunch there because you can sit at the tables at passim whereas dinner can be a bit crowded i am a vegetarian and i love coming here for the array of yummy pizza and salad selections at a decent price my favorite pizzas are lunch for henry  mexican bean  portobello redhead  caesar salad yep  thats a pizza the special salads and pizzas are usually delicious as well
i took my mom here for lunch on her birthday it was a cold snowy day and we were seated right by the fireplace with a very diligent firetender who kept us perfectly warm and cozy the service was perfect and the food was really delicious i started off with the mushroom phyllo appetizer which had a perfectly flaky crust  with a center that was creamy and meaty with mushrooms in a way that only a non meateater could appreciate then i had the scallop special with an amazing red pepper sauce my mom had the butternut squash soup not vegetarian and the linguini concarciofi with grilled chicken homemade pasta and delicious sauce we ended the meal with one of the best key lime pies ive had real limes of course and fresh whipped cream we had to restrain ourselves from licking the plates this would be a great romantic date  especially if you sit near the fire
when you meet good friends for a sunday brunch and their seriously adorable two year old is hungry  a gigantic line out the door at the friendly toast is just not going to cut it enter abigails   a gracious second option that turned out to be a perfect choice  even if they didnt have any crayons and coloring in pictures they let us come in  even though they werent officially open for another ten minutes and we had our pick of the seating arrangements  a nice curved booth with two tables pushed together to accommodate our party of five service was excellent  the occasional check in without feeling like theyre hovering or interrupting  friendly and warm they went out of their way to offer some extra choices for the little miss and she eagerly chomped down on the fresh watermelon and a well done egg the adults were happy with their choices  from the spinach and tomato omelette  to the pulled pork hash  and brunch skillet we were allowed to linger over our coffee  tea  and bloody marys without feeling rushed and the conversation topics frequently returned to the stylings of phil collins and the whereabouts of mike and mechanics as the kitschy but fun 80s throwback soundtrack crooned overhead  somehow it just fit with the brunch timing abigails should be a first choice and shall be next time we brunch kendallstyle
this is hands down my favorite pizza of all the pizzas i have ever had  seriously  and i live in new york well  i was raised in the boston area and now i live in new york but my pizza allegiance has up till this point been entirely to new yorks pizzas okay technically ottos is from maine but thats beside the point   the point isyou have got to try their pizza for 3  i had a large slice of the roasted tomato  ricotta and basil and it was to die for yes there are no seats  yes i had to sit on a bench outside in the freezing cold in the snow to eat the slice  and yes it was entirely worth it and i am getting a little too passionate about ottos right now seriously people stop complaining about how theres nowhere to sit step outside  sit on a nice bench  peoplewatch  breathe some fresh air  and enjoy a delicious slice of pizza  nehu unfortunately i am heading back to new york again tomorrow and will not be back in boston for a bit but damn  i am so happy to have walked into ottos this afternoon i will definately be back here
in search of a good place to fetch both meat and veggie burgers i found charlies on yelp  considering most the reviewers were content with the food but not with the service  when almost every other burger place in the area seems to be frowned on tasteprice wise by the majority of yelpers  we went  the boyfriend had a double guinness cheese burger in his words  extremely  really good  i had the vegetarian reuben on rye and it was nothing short of amazing  so filling i couldnt finish my jalapeno poppers or even attempt the fries  the service was friendly  we were attended by not one but two waitresses second was possibly a bartender  the boyfriend says its his new favorite place  hes pretty picky so id say they surpassed expectations   music was muse and jenny lewis
i am infatuated with your ginger steamer   it doesnt hurt that this was the site of the best first date ive ever had  magic happened in this cafe
aha   a restaurant that does a vanilla with caramel shake right   the shake i had here was paws down the best ive had ever   i never wanted it to end
live yelping from shays right now this place is extremely cute with great outdoor seating great music and a nice homey vibe glad we finally checked it out
crema cafe is really the only decent cafe ive been able to find in or near harvard square  and thank god its here crema cafe has great coffee and really great food the sweet potato sandwich is really good and the scones both sweet and savory are fantastic maybe the best scones ive ever had such a great alternative to the starbucks around the corner
i love this place  the food is amazing  everything is fresh  delicious  healthy  and so cheap  the egg and eggplant pita sandwich rocks my socks off as do the many salads i have had there and all of their lemonades  where else can you get mint lemonade  star anise lemonade  or lavender lemonade that tastes amazing  not too sweet and its only 2 dollars  they also make their own hot sauce  which is the best stuff i have ever had
the darkness of their chocolate must have its own gravitational pull  because for some reason i keep ending up here  try the singlesource hot chocolates if youre a true chocoholic they also pull a very nice espresso the pastries are near to perfect  most importantly  this place is an automatic little slice of home  with enough atmosphere  personality  and sheer happiness to warm you up on even the coldest of winter nights
amazing bagels for a decent price  the location in a strip mall made me wary of this place  how good could it really be if its down the sidewalk from a subway  the answer awesome  the bagels were fresh and doughy  though by the time we got there at 11 options were very limited  the service was friendly and there were lots of seating options  i had a bagel with egg and swiss  delicious  just a word to outoftowners they wont toast your bagel unless you ask  definitely worth a stop at for breakfast  coffee  or even just bagels to go
one of my favorite places in bostoncambridge ever this is the place to go for the best sandwich ever i always get the roast beef and horseradish sandwich  which comes on the most amazing bread ever with amazing crispy thin fried onions their sticky buns are also heavenly  of course ive also tried the raspberry spritzer which was very refreshing with my sandwich overall  joanne change is a genius who  by the way  constructed a massive birthday cake for harvards 375th birthday google it  beware though at lunchtime it gets super packed  so be prepared to wait in line for a while  or get there at about 1145am to beat the rush
i think upstairs deserves credit simply based on its unique decor and ambiance its a great place for a special occasion or brunch i had the grilled sirloin and it was cooked perfectly  was tender and juicy  and was really delicious overall i have also come here for lunch and had their burger  which was also very tasty
the dark hot chocolate is amazing and the macaroonsluxembourgers melt in your mouth with a delicate and delicious mouthfeel  you really only need one or two  but eventually im going to work my way through all of the flavors  the only downside is that if its a cold day and you want to sit indoors and drink your hot chocolate or eat your mousepenguin truffle  it can be a long wait
if you are a fan of candy from around the world or of specialty chocolates  be prepared to spend at least an hour in this store  if you dont have a sweet tooth  there are lots of different salts  mustards  sauces  oils  and other specialty food items as well as a deli full of delicious cheeses and a wine selection to keep you entertained  even better  their website sells gift baskets including a kosher gift basket that you can buy for a foodie friend    or for yourself    
i shouldve written my review way back when i visited beirut back in september last year  i just found my notes and am actually pretty embarrassed that i didnt write it sooner  this little holeinthewall  is a family run establishment  it is truly a holeinthewall  where service is as honey dripping sweet as their home made baklava  everything is made fresh  everyday  portions are healthy and you feel very welcome and at home  we ordered almost everything on the menu  and still couldnt get enough  the owner spent quite time talking with us about his family history i kept asking  his ties back to ma and a very well recognized jeweler he is related to  the art work and his children  extremely friendly folks  who put their heart and soul into their meals  they serve a garlic excessive yogurt sauce that would make cardboard edible and keep dracula away for a week  and man  we couldnt get enough of it  we dipped fries in it  their lentils are fantastic  as were the falafel  lamb  salad  rice and other items on our table  we literally sampled almost everything on the menu  for a fraction of any of our normal meals  it is a no frills cafeteriastyle place  plastic utensils and paper plates people where the food is awesome  flavorful  inexpensive and service is warm and friendly  so why is it a 5 star in my book  because you cant beat the value and the soulfulness of simple food really well made  exceptionally well made  that has the character and the passion of the people that cook for you and take your business to heart  yes  even i can find 5 star dining in a hole in the wall  and im glad i did  this is great lebanese food  served and prepared by some really down to earth people
i tend to hate crazes  mostly because the main sentiment is craziness  cherry on top has been a pleasant surprise  though  i work across the street and have ended up going there a few times now  mostly for the tullys coffee they serve mate for all of you tea fiends  and theres nothing better than a sugarcaffeine rush at noon  whilst i was there today  they played a friendly fires song too in the hospital for those of you musically inclined folk  nothing like shakin your bootay while making it bigger  i tend to like a little junk in the trunk  especially my own  ok  i wrote this a while ago  and i have to say that my expectations have been blown away  the owner rocks  the staff is quite friendly  and even when the place is busy they still find the time to help  dont ever leave  cherry on top  i shant ever cheat on you with another
why do people insist on reviewing places based on what theyve read  if thats how the world worked id never leave my apartment  this is yelp  not your mothers house  nobody cares    i tried this place a couple of weeks ago  and it was quite delicious  the frozen yogurt sorry  i cant bring myself to say froyo for fear of violently vomitingits one of the only words that actually makes my insides hurt is really soft and delicious  and like the previous snob noted  wont give you lovehandles or diabetes  i dont go to confession after eating frozen yogurt without mochi  so im ok with the plethora of other wonderful items they have    the waffles are pretty damn awesome too  and  if you actually look at the sign which reads fresh fruit salads and hot dogs  its not primarily a frozen yogurt place  and its colombian    if youre in pasadena and want to try some tasty waffles  hot dogs  or frozen yogurt or go for all three  i dont judge  tutti frutti is your place  its not pinkberry  which is always a good thing when youre not in the mood for overdressedtrustfundhannahmontanalookalikes      id give it four stars  but the first review is so ridiculous i bumped it up a star
fast  cheap  tasty  just as described
great food truck  delicious burgers and josh and team are very friendly  the specials are the real treat though  whether its filet mignon sandwiches  thai fish soup  or lobster rolls  dont ask questions  just order the special and enjoy
very good  very large sandwich
great new food truck  get on their email list to follow them since they are not on twitter  have had the banh mi  the chicken pita  and the dry aged burger and all three were very good  i think  the greek style chicken pita on the homemade grilled pita is my favorite  very glad these guys set up shop so close to the office
the following items on the menu are the worlds best microbrewed beer  nachos  bread  olive oil  fish  chips  i stumbled upon it with my dad during my freshman year of college  and i was blown away by the food  and once i was able to drink legally it became my hangout for the remainder of college  perfect place to bring out of town visitors  dark  cozy  intelligent  its true boston
crushes pinkberry  red mangos original yogurt is sweeter and tastes much much better with fruits  with anything  than pinkberrys tart mediocre yogurt
the best thing ive ever had in my entire life  and so cheap  and so simple that i find it hard to describe it to friends and family back east  amazing  and i wonder why there arent carbon copies opening left and right  as is the case with pinkberry
came here for sunday brunch buffet with my usc friend  im new to indian food and the thought of being able to try several different dishes made me so excited i wanted to poop  its a tiny  intimate  no frills place with flatscreen tvs showing indian music videos and we were greeted by this lady in a sara who gave us the warmest  most attentive  grandmotherly greeting of my life  better than my own mothers after i got back from iraq i didnt really go to iraq    she brings you water and a basket of naan you can choose between regular or garlic garlic  then you grab a plate and dig into one of sixteen different dishes chicken and tofu curries  palak paneer  mushroom curry  jasmine rice and yellow rice with peas  items from the salad bar like yogurt w carrots and cucumbers  vanilla custard wfruit  mint or tamarind chutney  and for dessert drum roll gulab jamon  a crazy sweet doughnut soaked in more sugar  all for 9  the cost of brunch  then i pooped
what the fuck  closed  well  i can cross that off my list when i visit home  this was the secondbest brunch place that doubled as an amazing bar at night in boston  after soundbites in somerville  shiiiiiiit  rip  bside
the last review i read is correct  sooooooooooo much creamier and less tart than pinkberry  im a fan and will most likely not be going to pinkberry provided that more red mangos open up  i had a medium plain with strawberries  raspberries and carob chips  delightful    theres even a cool loungetype area to hang out in if you get there early enough to snag it  yum yum and yum
delightful  delightful i cant believe its only 160 calories but i highly recommend this spot  my friend had the pomegranate which was tasty and i had the donnatella versace and something else  cappuccino and cookies  go and get 2 scoops
i ordered the don its a pretty good sandwich  and its averagely priced  i love how they shave the cabbage to thin pieces its easier to eat it that way
the best fro yo in la their fro yo is very natural fructose free
love at first bite my girlfriend introduced me to this place two years ago and i am still in love with their carne asada burrito my friends and i hit this place up at least once a month its cheap  fast  and good it tastes very authentic it doesnt taste americanized i have also had their chile relleno once before it was good but i still love their carne asada burritos more  i dont think i could handle their carne asada fries just looking at them makes my blood pressure shoot up
the cheapest oooorgasmic experience in los angeles diddy riese contributed to my freshman 15  but every single time i ran  i lived in westwood  to diddy i left with a smile my favorite diddy is vanilla ice cream between a peanut butter and sugar cookie it has never disappointed me theres always lines outside  but be patient and you will get your diddygasm its the cheapest dessert in westwood only 150
i thought shops like this doesnt exist anymore because these days desserts like these are overpriced and over sweet   delicious cookies 3 for 1   ice cream sandwich for 150   open late hours  basic  simple delicious cookies and ice cream   my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nuts cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream mmmmmm   this place will knock your sweet tooth off and will definitely win you over then any overpriced ice cream sandwich food trucks  or overpriced mrs  somebody cookies shop ps the only negatives are cash only  and parking
if i had gone to ucla for undergrad  it would have been freshmen 35 at least with diddy riese right around the corner    bad breakup    hot summer night   study break    all perfect occasions for a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two warm cookies   for 150  i am glad i live far away enough that i can only get it once every couple of years
the best pizza ive ever had was in new york cant remember the name and in boston a place in the north end it turns out that the bostonian place was owned and run by the grandmother of the fellow who owns and runs damores pizza a mini chain in la somehow he manages to create an absurdly great pizza with insanely low amounts of fat and calories  compared to slop and crap giants like pizza hut  dominos  etc this guys pizza was rated as the number one pizza in the country by another ratings site that i shant mention here on yelp  why lemme tell ya incredibly thin  incredibly crisp crust that has leagues of flavor in it  along with massively high quality ingredients quite simply  the tastetexture combination is superior to any pizza ive had in la  and i am an immense pizza snob you have to like this particular style  of course if you prefer soggy  spongy  greasy spoons like the aforementioned pizza behemoths  you will be sorely disappointed ah well  your loss  i spoke with the owner  who was at the front serving customers  and discovered a place where the workers are friendly in that east coast kinda way hell  i actually found myself talking to other customers thats right  los angeles  talking to other people the vibe and decor are perfect and inviting   i worry that if he continues to expand  then the quality will go down  but based on my one experience here  damores will be my first choice for pizza when i have the urge i cant speak for his other locations  but the one in westwood is primo youll pay for it  he imports the water from boston  and you cant make a great a great pizza with cheap ingredients im wiling to fork out the extra dough to eat a pizza that had me blabbing and smiling about it all night long to my girlfriend yep  it was that good
i love this place the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is always inviting their grilled vegetable salad is to this day the best ive ever had and ive had a lot of them  i love that they serve breakfast all day and i had one incredible egg white veggie omelette i have no idea what it was about it  but it was one of the most flavorful and delicious omelettes ive ever had i can almost taste it nowoh sweet goodness plus  i love supporting a small business  something about that just makes the saladomelette even better
this is the best chinese food in ann arbor  my favorite thing there is the chicken in pineapple nest  fantastic  the service is also topnotch  friendly and fast  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is really nice too  i highly recommend it
they now have chicken curry pasties if you have an idea for a pasty  let them know  fantastic people brilliant in every way i will drive 100 miles here every couple of weeks just to stock up in their deliciousness
their homemade salsa and chips you get free with your meal is so freaking good i always go through 2 baskets good guac too big portions  fresh ingredients  not greasy and you can see your food being made a big plus for me when eating mexican i guess its nothing special  but they dont seem to do anything wrong which for the price is way 5 stars blows taco roca and baja fresh away in my opinion staff is always friendly good outdoor seating for people watching
best thai in slo good atmosphere if you want it spicy you really have to convince them if you order medium spicy it will taste like what you would get if you ordered mild in a big city thai place  get the pineapple fried rice and the pad ke mow you wont be disappointed the waiters always seem kind of shy and unconfident but they get the job done
keep is simple and get the gyro plate fresh made hummas and pita im not a fan of the schwarma  but maybe thats just me i dont really get the petrajaffa thing it seems like the same food to me petra has a little bit better atmosphere except dont eat downstairs but it takes longer to get your food
its not fine dining or anything  but i give it 5 stars because you will get exactly what you wanted coming in here if you think a chicken pot pie or a pot roast wrapped up in a pastry sounds good when you go in  no way youre getting disappointed it is what it is and theyve done it right  just me  but i like the pastys that come with the brown gravy best the red wine reduction drippings is lighter and the cheese based is greasier  service is very friendly  check them out at farmers market portable smaller pastys at a smaller price
get the buzz burrito order with cheddar not american cheese unless you want ruin it nuff said
love this place service is great and theres always a ton of good options to choose from i am giving them a 5 star review because of the value were else can you go and get a full meal for under 10 bucks thats with dessert
really cool store best coffee selection ive ever seen i highly recommend the kenyan iyego beans to die for cool selection of kitchen gear as well its pricey  but if you catch them at their annual sale  which i believe is during the summer months  you can get  some great deals awesome deli as well everything in this store is first class  i love their wide selection of allclad products as well
i cant believe this place doesnt have better reviews ive been coming here for years and always have a great experience frankly  my friend and i concluded that we dont come here enough some people are saying they dont like the interior decor or the atmosphere  and thats what i love about it its dim  wood panel walls  a very 70s vibe the staff is super friendly and treat you like family my friend and i got the hummus and split the lamb kabob its a little pricy but you get so much food for the price you get a delicious salad with an awesome dressing  an egg and lemon soup  which i couldnt get enough of the taste was tantalizing i wanted to drink the damn stuff then our main dish  the lamb kabob on top of rice with veggies the lamb was delicious it was so succulent  juicy  tender  and not gamey upon my first bite i thought they accidentally gave us filet mignon sooooo good  then you get baklava and a desert wine  which wasnt too sweet and had a hint of a coffee aroma and flavor we also got a bottle of greek red wine  which was cheap and topped the meal off delightfully i love this place and will make an effort to become a regular
love love love their food  1 i was amazed at their iphone credit card machine  2 korean drinks  tried a melon soda that was quite yummy 3 theres always a line attesting to its popularity  but the wait for my food has never been more than 58 minutes 4 they have different specials all the time  which keep me coming back to try new korean food 5 i can see them cook food through the window  so i know everything is clean 6 free samples  i love mama kims  and would come here for lunch  dinner  or something in between  i love their korean dumplings made with kimchee it was one of their special items  everybody needs to try out the food truck revolution
absolutely wonderful service and great coffee  i come here regularly and get a mocha coffee the staff is quick and efficient and very fun they are good at what their doing and it looks like they love what their doing very cool environment  fun staff  and most importantly good coffee
good lord how can bread be so good i keep thinking about it and it makes my mouth water i love all the kebabs i would suggest the istanbul grill mixed grill so you can try a variety have a nice cold efes pilsen to wash it down
not much i can say that hasnt already been said  but oh my  the rack of lamb was delicious it really was amazing to me how much i loved it highly recommended my friend really loves the foie gras there as well
i thought i should chime in about shiva since i love it so ill touch on the service since its been brought up ive been more than a handfull of times and only once was i disappointed in the service that time it seemed they only had one actual waiter with an almost full dining room i will however admit that many times i come and wish i could get them to just leave the water pitcher at my table  but thats mostly because the cups are small and i love to order the spicy hot chicken curry murgh madras i love the dal  both the black and yellow good samosas if youre not too experienced with indian food try the tandoori grill 15 it comes with naan  2 types of chicken  2 types of lamb   shrimp  dal  and rice pudding for dessert perfect for 2 people
dont need to write much about this place since most people have said what i would say bottom lineits a must try their assembly line is very efficient and they use all natural fresh gourmet ingredients it dont get much better than that
best place in town incredibly low prices for such great fresh food friendly owners must visit
everything is so unbelievably delicious at this place not especially pricey for the quality  their fresh mozzarella is great pretty much everything they make actually is its basically an upscale new york deli in princeton and a bit cheaper  tip avoid the small world line down the street and get coffee here
i always thought this place was always closed or a front for something until i had to commute for a summer in the morning and discovered it actually open on the way to the train best pastries you will ever find around here served by the hardest working owner ever nothing will be left by 11am
ambiance  service  and food were great for dinner a couple nights ago ive had ethiopian before  and awash met my expectations we happily left a big tip 
dangelos is an allpurpose italian market  its mostly a place to pick up food  though they do have a few indoor and outdoor tables that make it a great lunch place  they have a 5 princeton student lunch box special that is quite a great deal and their food is superhighquality and super tasty  the staff is generally super nice  too  its a great lunch spot
the cookie jar is a wonderful little place right on sixth st next to firehaus and across from tis bookstore  they have excellent cookies  but the best by far are the buttercream cookie sandwichesi prefer the vanilla buttercream frosting  but they make both choc and vanilla  i also bought many cookie cakes here for birthday parties  greek events  sporting events  etcit was the place to go  very friendly service and everything is homemade on the premises  i went back for memorial day weekend this past may and unfortunately it was closed when i visited campusi cannot wait to go back to have a cookie sandwich  mmmmmmm
one of my favorite establishments in the wonderful city of champaign  i cannot tell you how many times i have visited the custard cup during my 5 years  the u of i  favorites grasshopper and strawberry shortcake snowstorms  and the black and white sundae with marshmallow cream and cold fudge their specialty  i only wish that places like this existed in evanston
another establishment i frequented quite a bit while  the u of i  i loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces  fresh parmesan and a huge piece of garlic bread  it was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice  i took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with zasyou cannot go wrong  it does get super crowded during lunchtime  so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right ini need to go back and visit just to get me some zas
this was my favorite place to get gyros in town despite the heated debate over who had the best gyros zorbas vs niros gyros  i always sided with zorbas  the fixins added to the gyro tomato  onions and whatever else you wanted were always fresh and great quality  something that niros seemed to lack on more than one occasion  zorbas had daily specials like groovy tuesdays one dollar off classic gyro meals which kept me coming back every tuesday i attended classes at the university of illinois   however  on wednesday march 23  2011 zorbas was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business as of now  i dont know when  if ever theyll reopen their shop on green st but heres to hoping
mia zas here on green street is the original the other places of similar name just  zas  in champaign have disbanded from the franchise and are their own entities   mia zas is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of campus town conveniently adjacent to the university of illinois main quad  parking can be a bit difficult  but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location  bring money as parking enforcement is serious business in and around campus  depending on the time of day you may be hardpressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population if there isnt enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables  and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling  and italian inspired artwork on the walls  their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients  and everything is cooked to order itll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom pizza  pasta  panini  and salad options but never fear for those you that are indecisive mia zas offers more traditional favorites as well  prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get  and if you get extra items with that said you can get a pick 2 where you get half an order of pasta  salad  or panini served with another half order of salad  soup  or panini for just shy of 7 dollars without drink
every time ive been to cova for dinner  ive had something that blew my taste buds out of the water they change their menu constantly ive never had the same thing twice but ive never had anything i didnt like out of the four times that ive visited its completely evident when you have a meal here that the chef knows what hes doing as a general rule  the plates are composed  balanced  creative  and wellplated frankly  i was surprised that the dishes seemed so well thought out  because its really easy for a place listed as a wine bar to leave menu items as an afterthought and dont dare skip dessert  in addition to your standard ice cream  etc  theres always one creative twist on a classic for example  white chocolate cherry bread pudding ive picked the creative one every time and it was worth every last calorie    my one minor criticism was the shrimp risotto the problem it was just okay and there wasnt much plating when the other dishes make you close your eyes in happiness  just okay seems like a big contrast   they also have very reasonably priced wine flights that change from time to time  which is great if you like variety highly recommend cova for  lets say  a third date   i also had my bridal shower in their wine room  which was perfect for a small  sophisticated cocktail party of around 1520 people
best gelato in pittsburgh huge selection the place is small and usually the line is out the door be prepared 
this review is for the banquet facility my family had a special event in their party room this past weekend the point man a the restaurant was jim and he could not have been nicer or professional he told us he wouldnt be there the day of the event but he made sure another employee  dave  knew of our special needs the event went off smoothly and we could not have been happier with the food  service and price a great restaurant  to stage an event
i dined at ecco last week for the first time what a beautiful interior  the bar is comfortable with several small areas to have a quiet conversation in i found a good selection of wines and liquors if you chose the staff is friendly and dressed casually hip andy  the gm appeared to visit with several tables which i see as a great touch   the food was outstanding and i enjoy the style of serving family style the meat and cheese platter coupled with smaller plates is plenty we enjoyed the wine and loved the choice of carafe sizes   if you are looking for an upscale casual dining experience you can not go wrong at ecco i will certainly be back
love love love locally owned  and has a fun vibe when you enter in they provide wireless internet and a good place to study or have a quick meeting the coffee and espresso never has that awful burnt taste that other places have love the baked goods section they have such a wide variety of items in their display  but i dont think any of it is good if youre on a diet  close to many businesses so its always busy their downtown location is inconvenient if stopping by  by car their broad street location is much better situated for that and less crowded too
i love their weekend brunch a good selection of breakfast items and lunch items  their portions are large and i always have left overs their breakfast dishes come with either a carrot muffin or coffee cake they are both good  the coffee cake is sweet and sugary  so maybe not the best choice decently priced too  around 10 a dish
i write reviews about the food  im sure other things are relevant in a restaurantbut that aint why i go to restaurants  10 yeras ago there was a rash of restaurants that wanted to package nonhispanic foods inside tortillas  i think wraps was the most famous of them  but ive eaten in a dozen such places throughout the country in the last decade  far and away  mondeo pronto is the best    just one more case where the food in slo county is competitive with anything anywhereso long as you dont need atmosphere  my favoritethe one that makes my mouth water just thinking about it is the ahiwasabi wrap  its been a stable fixture of the menu since i started coming here 10 years agoand its still divine
wonderful food  basically all of it  tapas meets california sensibilities  may be the best restaurant in slo county  not much more to say  really good
best thing on the menu spicy chicken sandwich amazing along with some fresh squeezed lemonade gooood enough said   
why dont people know about this place its easily the best mexican food you can get near usc affordable definitely for sure this place trumps la barca if youre not looking for margaritas  get a mulita super delicious
have had sprinkles millions of times  but this was the first time where i was actually able to sit down and eat it like youre supposed to with the wooden fork peoplethis fork is magic sprinkles cupcakes usually have overly sugary and dry frosting  but the fork makes all of that disappear so that you have one delicious bite of moist cake infused with frosting also the woodiness of the fork adds a bit of flavor  worked well with the banana cupcake as always  the cake is moist and balances the frosting well i spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure out the magic of the fork and think i have it figured outor maybe its just a mind gamebut if anyone else figures it out  hit me up and well discuss our theories
my bro from fullerton came home for the weekend and we made this epic plan to go to berkeley and eat ourselves stupid after an epic meal at blondes  pizza place  we came here we came here for dessert i leave you with this information  we found ourselves having trouble with breathing because all we wanted was to bury ourselves in this amazing stuff they got you wouldnt dare miss out on this place
so much talk of coming here  so many opportunities to do so and then april 5th comes along looking all sunny outside and i find myself next to cream   never be afraid of something new  especially when it comes to sweets i got a turtle cookie literally baked to perfection  soft and chewy and golden gate caramel swirl ice cream in the middle  all for two dollars   it was amazing i dont know how else to put it it was like a dessert from my dreams  i think what i appreciate the most is the freshness of the ingredients  they are making cookies all day and the ice cream was so good and im not even a huge fan of caramel ice cream   to all those who havent experienced it yet  you are definitely missing out
im sorry but caspers hotdogs prices are getting out of control  poor college student can get a damn hot dog for cheap   this place has a huge selection of hot dogs  links  and sausages for 3 dollars only totally sold there was a young guy running the tiny place by himself who was really nice and helpful with me deciding on what i should get   i got a hot link it came on a really nice bread roll and then a guy sitting next to me suggested that i put the krout and the hot russian mustard on the guy had obviously been there plenty of times because thats exactly what i was looking for   the link was really good and all the stuff with it but i think the bread did the trick for me it was toasted and soft  just what i was looking for thank you top dog  next time im hungry and dont feel like spending a lot of money  youll be seeing me
i went to this bar in the 70s with no money and no friends times have come full circle and it has not changed the floor  bar  all the same the vibeperfect for not feeling guilty for drinking at 330 on a monday afternoon if anything the food is lots better and stupid cheap  maybe ill start at noon next time
when i recently went to visit a friend in chapel hill  we went out and came here for a drink or two i immediately loved the atmosphere  probably because it reminded me of some of the pubs here in boston  its fun  lively  and cozy as well  and our waitress was so great she was professional and fun at the same time ifwhen i come back to the area  i definitely want to hit this place up again
if youre in the mood for creamy  thick  flavorful ice cream  then this definitely is the place for you they do have a variety of choices that could fit most palettes  i had the chocolate hazelnut  which really was fabulous  but the belgian chocolate was also delicious the portions are huge i got the two scoops and couldnt finish it it was also about 550 for two scoops  which is pretty expensive however  i definitely thinks its worth the splurgedespite the lingering stomachache that i may or may not still have from it
i madly appreciate grendels  if only for the fact that they fought a supreme court case to keep their doors open  gotta fightfor your right to party  etc etc  anyways  their food is a complaint i hear alot  but its wicked cheap and usually not the reason i come here  the waitresses are unbelievably patient given how disorganized my groups have been  probably my favorite bar in boston
i basically live here  the waiters dont even give us menus anymore because i always get the blonde on blonde w spinach  i was an avid meat eater before i started coming here  and now im a vegetarian  go figure
this place was definitely a staple in my year of being a premed and studying 247365  the woman who bartenders was always really sweet to me  the food feels pretty healthy relative to the other greasy spoons in the square  les is not perfect  but i think its perfectly imperfect  fresh rolls are great  the chicken soup is kickass  the quality can vary week to week  but for its location  speed  price  and general courtesy of all the waiters  waitresses  it really cant be beat
i love it a little dingy which is all ok because they have the best jukebox ever     rock  roll  good cheap beer  yes
this place is hidden in the charles hotel luckily  it closes at 2 am so this is usually the last stop before the customary shawarma run across the street at the end of a night out hotel or nonhotel patrons can come here for classic old fashioneds and the like and crazy drinks like the good guy most of the time the drinks are fine  though sometimes they will make them with slightly lower level liquor  never had the food here  so cant comment on it  the 5 star rating probably includes the sentimental value as well
its a dosa place in the back of an indian grocery store  they play bollywood music videos on a flat screen tv next to the refrigerator where you get your own drinks  this place screams central square  and it is awesome  the dosas are good  comparable to the old rongoli out on brighton avenue  and a lot cheaper  sure  everything comes on an orange tray and in styrofoam  but i didnt come to a restaurant  again in the back of a grocery store  so that i could experience fourstar china service  i wanted cheap rice  some naan  and a good dosa  and these were all things i got  plus the unusual atmosphere of the place    if youre looking for more sophisticated dining experiences  this probably isnt the place to go  if you want an interesting atmosphere  and cheap  solid food  this is a great location  plus  its a little hidden  so you can get some hipstercred points if you know about it and your friends dont
straight up  the best burgers around boston  no problems there  they are huge  malformed  and juicy  theres a thousand options for toppings and the fries will stick directly to your aorta  its heaven on a bun  capped with heartdestroying cheddar and mushrooms  the thing that makes bartleys awesome in my mind  though  aside from just how good the burgers are  is that eating there is an experience  whether theyve always done business the way they have  or whether it was set up to be sort of tourist trapy  i dont know  but its sweet  the place is always supercrowded  so youll be waiting in line on massachusetts avenue for a good 2030 minutes  and a cranky old man will give you menus and pester you for your order at least 15 times before you get to the door  when you finally do get in  the staff will throw you at whatever open spot theyve got  and since most of the place is set up in long trestle tables  expect to be rubbing elbows with another group of people youve never met  if you are an outrageous extrovert  this is a good time to make friends  if not  this is a good time to start a passiveaggressive war with the elbows of the person next to you  to truly enjoy bartleys  it helps to go in with the right mindset  if you like to enjoy leisurely meals with cocktails  this is not the place for you  if you want exotic cuisine or something other than a burger which they do have  but seriously  whats the point  this is not the place for you  if you want a burger  and then maybe a milkshake after it  and you want your face to melt when you eat it  then bartleys is going to rock your burgerneeding pants off    side note if you are coming in the winter  the line is not necessarily any shorter than the other months of the year  make sure you have a good coat
i live at redline    well at least i do every thursday night  go for the great music ngp style  stay for their tasty signature cocktails  and crazy mix of people all doing their part to make redline the best place to be in harvard sq  you have to visit redline on a thursday night  it is totally worth battling a hangover the next day at work
my favorite lunch spot in harvard sq  they have great lunchtime specials  395 for a perfectly portioned sandwich or burger  try the french dip  i promise it will be the best one you have ever had  the food also arrives at your table very quickly so you have plenty of time for lunch and a few errands on your lunch break  this is also a great place to head to after work  all of their food is 12 off from 500pm to 700pm and on sunday they have a variety of apps for 1  fyi rachel ray recently visited this spot and featured it on her show 40 a day
this is probably one of the best places in boston  the service is excellent and very well prepare to answer any questions  the owner whos also the hostess  busser  food runner is very helpful and goes out of her way to make sure everything fine  but most importantly is the food it is simply amazing  the tasting is so worth it since you get to try a little bit of everything i know that this will be my place to go for anything special 
ive been here twice  the first time was a weekend night sometime in the winter  the winter in new england lasts so long i have no way of remembering what month it was  but it was packed with good looking people drinking heavily  today i went and ate lunch outside  its early august  and it was extremely comfortable compared to the heat wave condition that ive grown accustomed to  the lunch specials are about 5 and i have to recommend the spinach pie  rice pilaf thursday only  my date wrapped it up with a cappuccino  which i thought was very classy  then on the way out i gave a couple bucks to the busking musician out in the park  it was a great day  and whether its winter or summer  grendels good
absolutely amazing    be it 2 am or 2 pm and everytime between antonios has the best pizza you will ever have  and its great for people with different tastes  you truly satisfy whatever craving you might have  try one of the amazing concoctions  or just go for hot cheese up front
i came in here with a friend before reviewing a show at the middle east to grab a quick drink it was really crowded in here and people were waiting for tables i was immediately drawn to the warmth and decor of the place it managed to be both welcoming and quirky  without seeming like it was trying too hard to be hipster chic   lisa  the manager  owner  welcomed my friend and i in like we were out of town friends in for a visit she was so nice and friendly and went out of her way to find us a spot at the bar she did while we were waiting  i asked her in my usual fashion if anything was glutenfree  just for future reference she said the kebabs certainly are and that any of the dips could be served with tortilla chips instead of pita bread score whether or not the chips are fried inhouse and therefore contaminate by any glutenous foods fried in the same oil  i couldnt say  but i would certainly check before ordering she said other things on the menu probably were  but as i wasnt planning on eating there that night  it seemed obnoxious to go over each item  once seated at the bar  i ordered a glass of champagnehey  every day in sally world is celebrationworthyand turns out they didnt have any available  but the really nice and adorable in a cute little dress bartender gave me a single glass of one that they only sell by bottle wohoo thanks for breaking the rules  cute bartender chick she was really nice  i didnt get her name  but she managed to be really friendly without disrupting the conversation between my friend and ithe sign of a really great bartender  ill be back for kebabs bonus points for being connected to a venue i spend half my life inside
grendels has now updated their website and their staff on which items on the menu are safe for glutards like me so  if youre glutenfree  head over to their website for a gf menuthey have them in the bar  too  so youll be all set enjoy your quinoa  everyone
if theres one thing that will kill me before im 40  its breakfast buffets  this review is based solely on that weekend offeringits the first and only time ive been there  i was in the kendall area looking for brunch  stopped by mc2  i have to say  it wasnt what i expected  ive only been to 2 types of hotel breakfast buffets soggy piles of mess in some undecorated alcove near the lobby and exorbitant  colorful feasts  i wasnt really up for slop or a 40 meal  but i checked in anyway    i think  at 18  its actually fairly well priced  its not uber fancy  but everything was just good  theres a guy wholl make you an omelet  pancakes are cooked to order  it comes with juice and coffee  servers are friendly  theres a wide array of nice pastries and things to put in your yogurt or whatever someone would put dried apples in  and the breakfast staples stored in those steamy metal contraptions were somehow not damaged by their presentation eggs fluffy  bacon crispeven the french toast had crisp to it  which was surprising given the context    you know  i think im going to bump my 4 up to 5  if this were a few bucks cheaper and if i had some backup arteries for when mine get all clogged  id probably be there every weekend
i used to drive from portsmouth  nh on a semiregular basis to get a fix  usually vienna finger cookie or ginger snap molasses  but if theres a new flavor that doesnt sound repulsive guinness ice cream doesnt appeal to me so much  but earl gray and cocoa pudding win  best ice cream ever  the layout is a little goofy half of the people walk down past the big table and then turn left  half go by the register  making a chaotic line  the chairs are generally uncomfortable  and its crazy expensive for ice cream  five stars nonetheless  also  went for brunch last week  had buttermilk pancakes with warm apple stuff and maple syrup  great little crisp to the outsides of the pancakes  real maple syrup  yum
fabulous place for a beer event william rolled out the red carpet for my group of 20ish for a thursday evening beer meetup   whats more  our server ryan was topnotch friendly  attentive  accommodating and patient   i loved being able to showcase friendly toast as a beer mecca for people in and outside of cambridge its a great option for dinner  too  especially when you want to pair their amazing french toast and delicious whip creme with the beer of your choice   this place is a total win
dan  the gm  rocks   when i contacted him about hosting a craft beer meetup httpwwwmeetupcomcraftbeercrew for about 30 people  he was happy to oblige more so  he was communicative  helpful in selecting costeffective grub options and friendly when finalizing the deets of our event   i cant thank him enough  when we arrived the day of  the staff was  for the most part  friendly as a collective  we felt the bartender was the least friendly  but thats okay  because our group was taken care of by amanda and liz   quickly  when i arrived  i ordered 3 of their delish beer towers  filled with amber ale i also ordered pizza  asking for the slices to be thinner to accommodate hungry beer lovers they happily obliged   i was surprised to see how slow this place was on a sunday afternoonevening  but thats okay it gave us the perfect opportunity to socialize without feeling like being in the way   thanks  dan and cbc for being so gracious we had a fabulous time and will most definitely be back
this just in   grafton street pub impresses with meat and veggie burgers  for meat eaters you can get a pretty mean burger here  cooked to order medium rare tasted amazing especially paired with their rotating tap  berkshires coffee haus porter side salad had a bit too much dressing on it  for vegetarians you can also get a mean  burger here its the toasted chickpea burger and it was delicious it comes with no cheese  but grafton will gladly add a slice  if you fancy that fries were a tad over salted  what a great place  im still in love
loved wowed by great service  really authentic and wellseasoned food with huge portions  great atmosphere  and the fact that its a byob came here for dinner with a good friend on a sunday evening good time to go  by the way  the restaurant was almost exclusively ours shared the caesar salad  papardelli  and the gnocchi with shrimp id highly recommend salento maybe not as a dineouteveryday kind of place because your wallet would be bust as a student  but a special nightsuper yums italian kind of place amazing homemade pasta  attentive service  did i mention super yums
i really want to move to boston and one of the reasons is that i just ate the mac  cheese at veggie planet seriously amazing though the restaurant is tiny  i love the berkeleyesque  downtoearth atmosphere at veggie planet i came here for dinner with a friend and we both had the mac  cheese unreal i always thought of mac  cheese as an outofthecardboardboxseminasty experience  especially when overcheesed  but this one was mindboggling a medley of cheeses  along with tomatoes  broccoli  and scallions maybe a little bit greasy  but amazing im totally coming back
definitely a find i just moved in around the corner and came here hoping to find thai food that would match up to the thai restaurants in new haven success my boyfriend and i loved the dishes we ordered a huge  spicy helping of som tum papaya salad  chicken with basil  and pad thai with beef and the atmosphere of the restaurant is quite lovely prices are quite reasonable  especially given the large portion sizes we had trouble finishing our dishes   pros byob ill remember this for next time  huge portions  wellflavored dishes  friendly staff  beautifully decorated restaurant  cons ill have to think about this ill get back to you
this has to be one of the best pizza shops in massachusetts if not one of the best ever  they use a wide variety of all the fresh ingredients that you can think of to make some of the most delicious slices known to man   upon entering youre presented with a case of various slices and pies of every sort imaginable  some of my favorites a blackbeanavocadospicy chickenranch  buffalochickenblue cheese  honeymustard chicken  chicken quesadilla  tomatobasil  hawaiian  avocado  i could keep going forever because its all great  and yes  for you conventionalpizzaonly people they do have a good sicilian cheese and pepperoni  i make sure to stop here at least once every time i come through amherst and i recommend you do the same
grendels den is my favorite bar in harvard square  low key  good beer  good service  and 5 dollar nachos  i go here for a quick beer and snack whenever i miss dinner  unconditional recommendation
im in los angeles right now wishing i was in the 02138 eating a border cafe burrito ill pay anyone willing to ship me one  border cafe is so good  i used to eat there by myself at least once a week  the chips are ridiculous  and i mean ridiculous  it gets to the point where ive eaten two basket of chips  havent started my entre  and still cant stop grabbing more and stuffing my mouth  they should be illegal just for their addictiveness  every thing else is good  im pretty borring and usually just order a chicken burrito  but damn  that burrito is delicious  border cafe probably not too authentic  but worth the visit  oh yeah  and the prices are great  my meal including tax and tip is usually just 10 dollars
the place rocks   good beer good jukebox good bartenders good crowd good times   sounds like the people from the politely elevated bar crawl are a bunch of douchebags
best deal in the boston area where else can you get a decent meal and a nice beer for under 10
as you can tell by my previous reviews  im pretty much a prick and dont give a place 5 stars unless it is remarkable in some respect   anyway  i cant say enough about how good my experience at abigails was   to start   the staff are outstanding they made you feel right at home from instant  you walk in the hostess  the server  the bartender and even the owner sarah who seemed to greet every costumer made you feel very welcomedand the place was packed   the music is top notch the staff bring in their own vinyl and the choices are perfect i like hall and oats and ian durry a lot   the food  aps guoda fries with bacon dangerously fucking rad      oysters outstanding and huge   entres the way i judge a restaurant is by how well their steak tastes medium rare the grass feed rib eye really got me going it was massive  delicious and cooked perfectly    the drinks wow the bartender knows what t he is doing  well done  oh and ps  to  nancy p  there is obviously a reason why you were sitting alone
i think charlies is cool i was looking for a laid back place to celebrate my 21st with a few friends and i came across charlies on this website a review mentioned it being dirty and the food being soso  but i had a really great experience i got the double guacamole cheeseburger and it was delicious someone had mentioned that they dont substitute sides but the waitress gave me an option of chips or fries it is a mixed crowd  but everyone seems to agree on the jukebox and we listened to great music all night and enjoyed some good beers and good food we even dared to order dessert and the apple dumpling was really good karaoke started around 1030 and this is when it started getting crowded  but we managed to snag a booth and keep it for the night arrive around 9 if you want a seat at a booth or table the bathroom is kind of sketchy but nothing worth losing a star over overall  charlies was a really good experience and i cant wait to go back
one of the coziest spots in harvard square on a winter evening love the brick walls and the cheap menu the half price menu is a real steal and worth the trek out to cambridge usually just go for appetizers when with friends and we often get the hot spinach and artichoke dip my best friend and i were fans of an appetizer that is no longer featured bread with tomato sauce but regardless of the menu changes i still enjoy myself when i go to grendels whether its a humid summer night and you are sitting outside or cozying up inside on a winter night  gendels is a spot where you will find yourself comfortable and at home  among strangers
whenever i walk into sweet the 22 yearold girl i am turns into a 9 yearold at the sight of cupcakes lined up in the shiny case and see the wizard of oz playing on the flat screen the cupcakesomg you know how you walked into johnny cupcakes for the first time and were totally disappointed that the only thing the store provided for you to eat were some mints let sweet fill your cupcake void without feeling pressured to buy a 35 t shirt to fill the cupcake void left by a misleading name   every single cupcake is delicious i havent tried them all but i assume they all rock and i love that they play delicious girly movies like marie antoinette and breakfast at tiffanys all of this writing about cupcakes has reminded me that the last time i visited i ate one in house and bought a dark chocolate with vanilla icing cupcake to go im going to go eat it now and if you are reading this you should head out and grab yourself one too
have gone to this place everyday for almost the entire year now coffee is perfect the sweetest and friendliest people work there very enjoyable atmosphere  food the very very healthy great unique sandwiches with best vegetables highly recommended
hmmmm where should i start i went there with my sister and two friends on a sunday night the place was crowded  must have reservation inside was lovely  very nice ambiance  food was amazing they dont have too many different food  on the menu but everything that we ordered was great a little pricey however  service was good but our server was not friendly at all but he still did a great job serving us he was attentive and had a great timing with food he made a few suggestions for drinks and we were happy with our orders  highly recommended one glass of wine  one appetizer  one entree  12 desert was almost 50
omfg best burritos ever i go to the south west and travel through socal  nm and az and have yet to have a better burritos i know that the real mexican burritos are nothing like this  but for a mission style beanricecheeseveggie wrap this is the place
the most important meal of the day  yes boys and girls there is a place to get a great breakfast at a reasonable price and zoes is where you find it and they know how to do it right no runny or over cooked eggs fluffy buttery goodness all around  one can easily miss this place as its located below and few other stores and restaurants  with a funky  colorful atmosphere much like a 50s or maybe 70s diner i dunno its funky ok   your basics are covered  as one should expect  but it doesnt stop there for those of you with more sophisticated pallets  they provide spinach avocado eggs benedict  several types of omelets  vegetarian  and mediterranean styles   but whats that you say your a big eater  well dont you fret my bottomless pit friend try the three sons breakfast  i did unlike the skimpy portions you might get at ihop or even josephs ii no offense but one will truly be satisfied eggs  beacon  toast  hash browns  and a full plate stacked of french toast not jus 2 slices  extra plus   not only breakfast but burgers  sandwiches and others are offered  smoothies and other drinks but coffee for me black with alil sugar   quick friendly service  and reasonable prices   watch out   parking can be not so fun its right on the edges of harvard square  one might have a wait  but like ive said in alot of my reviews thats not always a bad sign
came here with a large group for cocktails for my friends birthday she called ahead  let them know there would be a larger group  but wasnt sure how many would order food  how many would be there at once  etc in short  a booking managers nightmare but they were supernice and accommodating it being a monday night probably helped quite a bit as well  the service all night was spectacular  from the hostess desk to the waitstaff truly great i didnt eat  but had two different cocktails that were both tasty and very interesting mixes of flavors i will definitely be back
two words for the chilly days mulled wine   when i think of my brief time in cambridge  grendels is probably going to be one of two pubs that i think of its cozy  the staff are nice  the prices are reasonable  and the 12 price appetizers at happy hour make for an awesome afterclass discussion venue   it is smallif youre in a group larger than three and arriving after 6pm or so  it might be hard to get a seat still  its a spot with zero attitude and good beer and ale on tap  grendels slays
i love byob places like this  this is the uws sister of ivo  lulu  service is extremely friendly and the pre fixe price cannot be beat  we showed a bit before 7pm on a saturday night and had our choice of table  within 20 minutes  the whole place was full  everything we had was great  but i particularly enjoyed the pheasant pate and the duck leg confit
a contrasting ambience inside vs out  but both sides of the coin are worth choosing    my trip here was months back  but my impression of this place is entirely comfortable  but also hip  not sweatpant comfortable  lookin like a sloth  not hipster hip  a balance  a wonderful place to run in with friends that you havent seen in a while  entirely conducive to conversation  but not at the expense of your ears you can do work here if need be  but dont be surprised if someone strikes up a conversation but not a cigarette here
my roommate  joce  and i decided to bike to the algiers coffee house today for brunch  we didnt know what to expect  as soon as i walked in i knew i loved it  the restaurant is a two story building with lovely  authentic decorations and full of warmth  we wound ourselves around the staircase to the roof deck where we sat  besides being flanked by a beautiful blossoming tree  we also had a perfect view of the sidewalk  which was great for people watching  joce and i split a big plate of the best hommus very garlicky and both ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich with sumac  there was no rush for our table so ended up spending an hour and a half eating and reading  atop our harvard square perch  oh  and its vegetarian and vegan friendly 
i dont get in to charlies nearly enough these days  when i worked in the square it was a pretty regular spot to hit up after work id lunch there occasionally too cant really beat the pricethough it was always depressing to go in and not order a drinknow i usually only make it down there for the occassionalt trivia on sundays  when we started playing ttriva there a couple of years ago it was a huge improvement over playing at unos and there was generally plenty of room unfortunately  you generally have to turn up at least half an hour if not more in advance to get a table for trivia these days
having worked in harvard square for several years  grendels has always been one of my favorite spots for lunch or for drinks after work  while it can get a bit crowded during the frugal period known as happy hour ive found it a relatively quiet place to lunch  especially if you dont go out until 130 or 200    people have mentioned that the fondues not spectacular well  in the grand scheme of fondue  its not the best out there  but it is still tasty cheese with bread but during happy hour its 10 between 2 maybe more people and i cant think of many places you can a vat of molten cheesy goodness for anything approaching that price  ive always liked the grendel roast beef sandwich and the chicken breast sandwich with honey mustard as well as the shrimp caesar salad all of which find their way onto the lunch menu  one further note it seems you can now drink alcohol outside there though sadly no happy hour on the coveted patio chairs which is something i think everyone who frequents the place has been waiting for
absolutely one of my favorite places to sit and read  i like sitting outside  when its nice but i love the cozy cramped low ceilinged quarters sitting inside  one thing  ive noticed a propensity for tall waiters in this low clearance environmenti just dont get that
this was one of my favorites in harvard square during school  and i was happy to find that it was still going good and strong upon a visit last weekend  my favorite is the potato pizza  which has both sliced potatoes and little dollops of pureed potatoes yum  also delicious is the lobster and corn pizza
burdicks hot chocolate is rich and delicious  i always get the smallest size because thats all i can handle  but i enjoy every sip  whenever im in town i stop by to grab some of the white chocolate hot chocolate mix super expensive  but what can i say  its worth it for my dad who loves white chocolate
how have i not written a review for this place already  i love this place there are so many great memories here for me  so i am biased  i think i would regularly give this place 4 stars  but it earns 5 for some great memories  in sum  great deals cheap  tasty food is always a plus  wide varietyselection  combos such as sundeck combos available for people like me who want a little of everything  friendly service  delicious food  can be a fast meal not waiter service or you can spend a long time hanging outtalking there some people come and go  and no one will bother you about it  outside patio great when sunnygood weather  indoor seating available too  casual  accepts credit cards  convenient location for cal students
first of all  full disclosure i am friends with the owners  secondly  ive been coming here since before i knew them by name when they were still just a chai place when they still had the shaggy orange couch this place is a seattle stalwart and deservingly so  lets enumerate the ways really wellpulled coffee they have a clover and yes  you can get your coffee from it three jillion flavors of chai real yerba mate consistently friendly undiva like baristas commitment to direct trade an alt to fair trade and direct exchange  and support of farmers in centralsouth america more on that here httpwwwthestrangercomseattlecontentoid142605 great location by the american apparel bus stop late hoursmidnight on some nights consistent open mike and music programming cool modern chairs and a new upstairs  youll find this to be some of the best coffee in seattle
this place is great  ive been coming here since high school on the coffee price index using americano as an indicator they hover around a high median  but it is worth it   three rooms of seating  the upstairs especially good for studying or loafing  the front room good for being seen all windows onto the alleyparking lot great alley space  when its nice  folks hang out here and drink their coffee on the sidewalk and benches outside the cafe   sure hope the alley development plans dont wipe out this environment its one of the quickly disappearing weird winchester mansion esque seattle places with multiple entriesexits and tiny bathrooms and weird upstairs rooms and public access tv stars see shifterland pulling your coffeethis means go there   they have open mic upstairs too  though rumor is you cant smoke up there anymore  also  they always seem to have interesting printed materials  zines  posters etc around more so than other places on the ave  oh another thing  if youre older than 21 you wont feel like you stick out like a sore thumb here unlike some other ave cafes  which is a huge a
love this place best vietnamese sandwiches fresh  good tofu  cheap  and theyll put hoisinsri racha on it if you ask them outside of the id hands down the friendliest restaurant on the ave  too i always smile when i leave this place spend money there
light and bright situated on a corner  light wood decor and furniture i could spend some time here  giant boardroom table the only drawback  seats about 24 i think  guess its great if you come in with your entire sorority but if youre just the one person makes it awkward to sit there  at least for me  not being a fan of sharing my space  or my anything else  with strangers
awesome  i loved it  friendly staff  they take the time to prepare your food lovingly and to get to know you  perfect place for fussy nuts like me  though i am not a vegan  i do try to avoid dairy  so eating at a predominently vegan restaurant allowed me to order without worrying about getting a dairy stomach  i had the peanut tempeh dish  my vegetarian friend was worried i wouldnt like it  yeah  right  it was amazing  menu is seasonal  whole thing changes every 12 weeks or so  so go and enjoy  enjoy it now  ps small restaurant  relaxed  nice but casual
this place can be a bit pricey  but it is definitely worth it they usually have a nice line as well  so i suggest calling in your order i like chicken alfredo particularly 
ive been here twice already the first time was at one of charlies friends and family preview nights my friends and i ordered several dishes and ate them family style the food was tasty and it was nice catching up with charlie   the second time around  i dropped by and ordered some items to go because i was too lazy to cook dinner that evening i was just coming from the gym and i was starving i ordered several of the vegetarian dishes sushi verduras  daily tempura  eggplant tiger bowl  crimson quinoa salad  chilly udon noodles  and braised greens  almond butter i couldnt get home fast enough the food smelled so good when i finally got home  i was not disappointed  even the tempura held up i gobbled up charlies food and felt good about it because i know that charlie makes his food only with the bestest  freshest ingredients i cant wait for when the market agogo part of his cafe opens up which is next month  by the way  update 216 just had to upgrade this place charlie has added three types of hamburgers to the menu and i get the feeling that more yummy options will be added as he goes along
amazing crepes with fresh ingredients  made right before your eyes theres a reason that the line goes halfway down the block
lucky i ran into this place when walking around so many soda varieties get the blue cream  from different companies and places ditto for the candy nice retroish atmosphere also
every time my old roomie and bff comes into town  she insists on treehouse nachos better known by the now ancient moniker of hippie nachos and pitchers of beer this place is cheap  open late  and the quality of the ingredients is superb  freshman year  the only heavily bearded guy in my dorm would come here and speak in bombastic spanish with the guy behind the counter and buy the rest of us pitchers because he looked 45 he was also the dorms pot and ex dealer and one time had to chuck his 250 bong and weed out of his window when the administration was supposedly coming to bust him the next day  he was on his hands and knees scrounging around for his weed in the bushes outside his window   now  that tangent is not to say that the treehouse is lax on carding i still get carded when i go there now but i am saying that if youre stocky  have a big ol beard  and speak in ludicrously melodramatic spanish like the radio announcers  you might just be able to slip by them
ive been buying metabolic kitchen meals at equinox the meals are so delicious you definitely dont feel like youre eating diet food   at 13  the meals arent super cheap  but  they are cheaper than almost any meal at a sit down restaurant in palo alto when i havent planned ahead and made my own healthy meal  its an easy and quick fix
i write this with trepidation because a place this fun can only last a few more months before it starts sucking its housed in the old house of blues  and theyve basically kept it all the same first floor barrestaurant  second floor barndance floor look with crap all over the walls that i couldnt really make out in my bleary eyed state lots of balck and white pics i guess ok enough about that   so its basically a small dance floor  but both weekend nights i went  it wasnt crazy crowded they played exactly the music my girls and i would have played had we still lived in dorm rooms and jumped on our beds and danced around in a vanilla vodka and diet coke induced haze it literally felt like we were back in our dorm room when we used to play i touch myself and then whip off our shirts and shimmy up and down bedposts and im getting ahead of myself though  so three years out of college  this place made me feel like a teenybopper again updated music not the same stuff as we had in college   smirnoff and absolut vanilla vodka  lots of nice harvard men and very little competition in the female department a good time was had by all we went here after having a stupefyingly boring experience at mantra in boston but thats another review
sensational  an adult cupcake with oozyfilling  buttercream frosting was to die for  at last nights victory party  i ate a yummy meyer lemon cupcake  a coffeeflavored one  and a chocolate one    im not usually a cupcake fanatic  but these were delicious from the soft cake to the luscious filling to the airy  sublime frosting  worth the occasional splurge
first time here and i loved the decor very homey  warm  and elegant plus they had beautiful fresh flowers on the tables  lily  rose  tulips maybe because it was just valentines  but it was lovely our waitress was young and sweet overall fabulous service  very attentive staff  from host to the food runners      we just thought everything was well presented and delicious we ordered the mushroom cake  which is as yummy as everyone says we also got the beet and gorgonzola tart not blown away by this one  tossed green salad loved the cherry tomatoes and crispy goat cheese  split pea and minestrone soup  clam chowder  mahi mahi  mussels  lasagna  and gnocchi everything was very tasty and fresh i didnt love the sweetness of the mashed potatoes though but overall we were quite impressed by the food and service for dessert we got the bread pudding which was amazing so glad to have discovered this gem of a restaurant
you know youve found a great europeanstyle cafe when you hear a different euro language spoken at each table if the expats like it  it must be good the soups and sandwiches are fantastic  quick  delicious  and perfectlyportioned la douce france also makes their own pastries  and the nutella sandwiches in particular homemade croissants with a nutella overlay are a wonder   the prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and fast several of the same guys have been working there for years  with turnover so low i suspect that management is pretty good to their employees a couple of the guys even remember when i was briefly in a wheelchair following an injury  and still ask how im doing even though im up and mobile a year later  nice people  good simple food what more could you ask for
when i moved out of the mission and away from pizzeria delfina  i thought i was leaving great pizza behind forever i was wrong howies serves the most beautiful thincrust pizza ive had on the peninsula the margherita is superb  and few dishes make me happier to no longer be a vegetarian than the meatball side although there are plenty of fine veg options on the menu  howies hasnt been open for long  but service is so smooth that it feels like theyve been operating for years its great to see a young business flourish like this  and i hope that howies maintains its success and that margherita pizza  guys  yowzer
best place to get produce near my house  it far outperforms wholefoods  safeway  trader joes  andronicos  i love the fruit here as well as the raw pastas  vegetables  olive oil  now if only they had fish  i definitely have to try the redwood city main store someday
tri tip sandwich  espn projection screens during nba playoffs or any type of playoffs  beerbottomless soda  sheer delight
come hungry i made arrangements for a family dinner for my husbands birthday here last night weve been wanting to try it for the longest time and between the churrascarias that ive been to in shanghai  brazil  and ca  this may very well be one of my tops the side bar actually has interesting items from your typical salad bar aside from the meat with side bar option  you can just go for the side bar where the only meats available with that option is prosciutto  salami  anchovies  and smoked trout we also ordered the tres leches cake which was just right   the service  food  atmosphere  are all solid to me and id recommend it to any meat lover looking to kill it ayce style
theres only three things in life guaranteed to put a smile on any twentysomething womans face shoes  sex and the city  and sprinkles cupcakes some people wait for iphones  i wait for sprinkles yes  i was waiting in line for a half hour to get into this cupcakery on a sunday afternoon alongside other cupcake fiends  yes  i heard many passerbyers question if such a thing was worth lining up for bottom line  theres probably always going to be a line to buy cupcakes from sprinkles why because these cupcakes are sweet morsels sent from heaven they arent overfrosted and sugarroided like confetti sprinkled cupcakes from your local supermarkets bakery department  they dont taste out of the betty crocker box from your churchs bake sale  and they dont taste like they have been sitting out for hours and hours or like theyve been refrigerated but yet they still manage to taste just as fresh and moist even 24 hours after youve brought them home  they are soft to the bite  crumble in your mouth  and slather coat your entire mouth with a balanced sweetness good best cupcake that 325 can buy also bought a 250 yogurt cupcake for my dog and as far as i can tell  he can attest to sprinkles ability to bake damned good cupcakes  ps i dont even know why people make a point to categorize the target audience of sprinkles as juicy sweatsuit and gucci sunglass wearing stay at home trophy moms all i saw were families  mothers with their daughters  couples  nerds  friends  etc
yet again  another 5 star review for this place but well deserved i finally got to experience the amazingness that is gracies last night  and boy was it unforgettable  first of all the ambiance alone gives this place 5 stars   stars everywhere  dim lighting  comfy benches with pillows  attentive staff  etcso great  my boyfriend and i split a bottle of wine which the server helped us pick out fantastic choice by her  and we loved it  the fresh bread was also great  i loved the classic french baguette  and with the homemade butter  i could have filled up on it alone  we then decided to go with the prix fixe menu that begins at 40 some special dishes have a slight upcharge  but well worth it  i started with the gnocchi and he had the poached egg  the gnocchi was the best i have ever had  no lie it melted in my mouth with bursts of flavor incredible  for entree i chose chicken ballotine and he had duck  both dishes were completely out of this world with impeccable presentation  we both completely devoured our plates  not a drop was left  dessert time i had the creme brulee and he had the cheese platter  again perfection and devoured in its entirety   we will absolutely  positively  100 be returning to gracies  without a doubt  next time  we are going to try the 7course wine pairing dinner i know it will be well worth the steep 90 price
so good so so good i had the ri coffee milk last night  absolutely amazing  will def be going back to find her to try more
went here for the first time the other day so good bento boxes are perfect for a healthy and light dinner option loved this place
5 words college  marijuana  doughnuts  fuck yeah im never sure if its a burden or a curse for them to be open all the time  but im not one to complain  snacks are snacks
great place for a burger  cheese sticks  a chicken salad or a milk shake they have a big screen tv  a couple of video games  and almost just enough parking this is 5 star rated for college cuisine if you like popcorn ice  use the machine on the left
friendly staffgreat queso  cold beer  and turkey sheriff
reminds me of the college dayssame great food as back thenslice of pizza and a greek salad is my order of choice

true storyi was in my car leaving a meeting downtown and i ordered jimmy johns on w anderson lane for delivery to my office on far west and mopac  before i could exit mopac  my office called me and said jimmy johns was waiting for me in the lobbyhow did they make the sandwich and beat me to the office when i was already in my car when i ordered it   amazingly fast and deliciousi prefer the white bread over the wheatgoto sandwich is the country clubbut all are good
kens kens kens always the best after a full night of dancing the ooeygooey soft sweet goodness of the eclair is my favorite combine that with the savory samosa or paneer wrap in another hand and you reach straight into what paradise must be like their donuts are probably the softest i have had i can go for an eclair right now the owner is always so pleasant and extra props because we share the same mother tongue
you will not have another snow cone better than sno beach i promise you that the ice is shaved so finely that it really does have the texture of snow the flavors are almost limitless they are a seasonal treat so make sure to get as much as you can during late spring  summer  and early fall personal favorite peach tea
while i occasionally have issues with the cash only policy  i give the metro 5 full stars because    i think their prices are pretty great  and they do have a good selection   lots of seating  and i dont know what everyone has against the chairs   huge windows for dragwatching   they have great hours   i can hold tutoring sessions there  and they dont mind if i sit there for an hour and a half without buying anything although i do try to leave a tip or buy something once i get paid   upstairs seating
i first visited toy joy without having heard any of the hype  and i was very pleasantly surprised i visit once or twice a month  and its easy to spend an hour there  checking out the new arrivals  as far as selection  it can be a little overwhelming  and it can take several trips around the store to actually see everything  but ive never had any problem finding gifts for myself and for others at toy joy ive found cool rattles for baby showers  a pirate coloring book they have a great pirate section for a 5yearold  small and inexpensive prizes for the class i teach  graduation presents for high schoolers  birthday gifts for my collegeaged friends  and neat stationarypens for a cousin just last night i was feeling crafty  and walked out of toy joy with a scarfknitting kit and a quilting set  if you cant find something for yourself or a friend at toy joy  its probably because youre really not looking closely enough  mixed in with the kitschy  the cheap  the insanely shiny  and the incredibly bizarre and i admit there are lots of the previous are truly cool puzzles  games  bagspurses  metal lunchboxes  candy  science toys  sea monkeys  baby toys  stickers  plastic animals of all shapes and sizes  varieties of frisbee  penspencils  stationary  jewelry  small pool toys  and even household items  the free gift wrap is also a definite plus  and it has always looked really nice when theyve wrapped gifts for me the staff are generally very helpful  and occasionally will have one of the toys out to play with and demonstrate overall  i think toy joy is a wonderful austin store
took my dad here for an early fathers day dinner  since i wasnt actually going to be in town for fathers day we got seated immediately and the server came right over and took our drink orders  we all ordered various versions of steaks except for the boy  who got a burger  and all ordered them well done everything came out perfect and delicious  and even my son ate every scrap of his food  i have no complaints here  service was excellent  food was great  and we were in and out in under an hour
i have to admit that every pizza place ive ever been to in my adult life has been held in comparison to arnis i grew up on arnis and i know everyone always says whatever pizza they grew up on is the best  but in this case its 100 true  arnis is thincrust  cut into squares  and is very generous with the toppings greasy as all heck so definitely not good for you in any way  shape or form  every year or so when i travel back to visit the family arnis is either my very first stop or its a place i go to shortly after i get there if i could figure out how to have my dad ship me out a fresh arnis pizza i would probably have to do it every month or so best pizza in the world  hands down
this place has great food  i have never had anything here that i didnt think was awesome  i dont mean that i just liked it  i thought it was amazing   the kabobs  moussaka  babaghanoush  all great the have a vegetarian bell pepper item forget the name that is very good too good service  good selection    the moussaka is my new favorite  its got a lot of flavor get the avocado salad if given a choice
hello  my name is kirsten  and im an addict  a gz cafe addict that is its honestly terrible that i have a class to the building next door to gz and an hour break in between classes to boot minimum of 3 days a week  i go to class  then take a study break at ground zero with a monthly milkshake or my all nighter fallback the chai latte with 2 shots of espresso and vanilla syrup is to me  as kryptonite is to clark kent   some days i go into gz with the soul purpose of studying and actively telling myself that i will not order anything today  im just here to study only to find a drink magically appear in my hand with no recollection of how it got there i just cant get enough  dear ground zero performance cafe   why must you do this to me  why i dont understand  sincerely  a gz addict
really enjoyed the margherita pizza 6 and truly prepared within 2 minutes  extra points for the freestyle coke machine  i love playing with that thing  will definitely be back and spread the word
i went with a friend although i had already had lunch and decided to get a chicken dumplingoh yeah  it was awesome  the sauce was delicious and the dumpling was not smallthat and some tea hit the spot
walked in and had just about the best  burger in the areathe abricott burger with gouda cheeseit was delicious  i also got the fries which are really  really  really thinly sliced  kinda like hash brown  but crispierthey were okbut the burger was the business  im going back for waffles
ok  first the good news  your establishment is awesome  not only are you serving hot dogs  sausages  brats and burgers on kings hawaiian bread but you also have the best tater tots ever  i love the fact that you are playing some early 80s music on the radio  reminding me of my older neighbors blasting the kmet back in the early 80s  i love the fact that there is a wide variety of condiments openly available to anybody who want themi love the fact that you can customize any of your itemsi will gladly give you 75 cents for sauteed mushrooms  i have to try your chili next time  i love that i ran into a longlost friend at your place  i love that you have an item called the fonz spicy italian sausage and pastrami with mozzarella melted on top  so good and then another item called the chachi  you guys rule  the bad news  you are within walking distance of my job      i cant eat like this all the time okjust sayin
i had the falafel wrap here and it was like 4 it was extremely good  however the chicken shwerma wrap i did not like so much the flavor just wasnt there  or maybe i just wasnt in the moment i do  from the experience recommend you not order that   parking is horrendous at lunch time also
a great find off broxton ave on a beautful sunny day in westwood i was starving the whole day and wanted to find a meal that would be filling and tasty i had preyelped this place and it had good reviews  so i decided to give it a try   theres a great outdoor seating outside  but since it was a warm day  i decided to dine in i asked the cashier their specialities and his recommendations and he was kind enough to explain the menu to me it sounded like everything was great i ordered the la cheesesteak sandwich and their famous garlic fries i took a seat in the dining area and waited for my food   the dining area was very nice  with beautiful tables and chairs and was cool inside it was casual enough for a simple lunch  too anyway  once i got my sandwich  i noticed the dressing on it was drippy and was begging to be be bitten into haha so  i did and digged into the garlic fries as well   ohman   the sandwich was devine and the garlic fries were pretty good too it came with a chipotleranch dip  which was tasty  too i was in sandwich heaven   this place seems to be hip with the college kids  as many of the patrons who were dining there were collegeaged but  i was there for the food i would recommend this place for anyone who wish to sink their teeth into a tasty sandwich superb
the house beers are great here  and if you dont like them they carry an assortment of other craft beers and domestic beers as well  the food here is great  some of the best pizza in tompkins county  great wings  burgers  salads  subs  calzones something for everyone and reasonably priced  plus karaoke every wednesday night in a relaxed friendly atmosphere no pressure to be perfect  just have fun and the host is fair in his rotation  giving everyone a  chance to sing
great karaoke every monday night ithacas longest running karaoke event 14 years and a host that doesnt play favorites  everyone gets a chance to sing
the plantation has been around for decades under a few owners and is still a favorite in the area great food at reasonable prices and specials almost every night of the week if you are looking for a bargain   karaoke every tuesday night is a blast along with 2 for 1 pints of miller lite and molson  large parking lot and a huge deck to sit outside on
great karaoke bar they have karaoke every tuesday and now saturdays also other live music on thursdays and fridays and djs once in a while
karaoke night here every thursday  on their stage with a great selection of music to chose from and a great host 
my favorite restaurant in austin  texas  where i went to throughout my years while at ut  that stuffed avacado entree is just simply heaven  and every time i go back to austin  i have to go indulge that dish  of course  dont forget to order your mexican margarita  the limit is 2 unless you want to try to go to all trudys around austin and get 2 from each  i have known someone to try itand fail that challenge at the second trudys  the only downside i have to this is the wait  unfortunately  they do not take reservations  and you cant get on the list unless your entire party is there  but  trust me  the wait is well worth it
i love love their mocha frap im a big frap fan  so i wish they had more choices for that you know how coffee nowadays is all filled with sugar and creme and etcand thats all you can taste well the coffee you can actually tastes the coffee you can taste the bitterness of it and though i do not like bitter tasting thingsi enjoyed this onevery autheniccoffee yum done just right the couches were all occupied when i came here  but they looked comfy anyway  good atmosphere  good coffeewhat more could you ask for just hope they had more selection in the frap department
pizza here is the thing love the pepperoni and onion  the cheese and mushroom  or the deluxe always fast and friendly  and usually clean stores the thin crust they use is delicious theres the right amount of greasiness without worrying me about getting a heart attack leftovers are amazing garlic bread is a good side so many delicious carbs ive heard tell the salads are good as well strombolis are a good choice if youre on your own for lunch and dont want to eat a whole pizza  like i do  and theres a little train at this location that delivers your drinks to you  and pictures of the town that are like 20 years ago
i miss sadakos great lunch deals  8 for california roll  teriyaki chicken  tempura shrimp and veggies  grilled veggies  pickles  and a soup and salad  and free tea  how can all of that food merit a rating less than 4stars and did i mention their food is awesome  sadako will always have a special place in my heart as it was the first restaurant that i tried sushi  my friend told me to try the sashimi and that was a mistake it was so fishytasting  i was almost turned off of the stuff forever but my friend also let me try some of her dragon roll tempura shrimp  cucumber  avocado  with eel on top and i was hooked the dragon roll is still one of my favorite rolls but i wish is wasnt so darn expensive 10  all of sadakos rolls are pretty good though and i enjoy their donburi rice bowls too    5 stars for the awesome lunch deals  i need to revisit sadako soon
best soup in michigan  this may be a bit of an exaggeration but le dog has some of the best soups ive ever eaten  ive never order hot dogs here and i dont care to  you come here for the soup  and honestly ive never had a bad soup and i used to eat here once a week when i lived in ann arbor    the only bad thing about the place is their very limited hours  le dog is only open 1130pm230pm  mondayfriday the main street location is open saturday same hours  i could make a dinner out of their soup  but alas there were many times when ive had class or a prior engagement that prevented me from enjoy this culinary sensation   that and theres no where to sit and eat in the winter when its snowing   ive even heard that the owner is gourmet chef thats worked in some pretty fancy restaurants   my favorite soup is the peanut udon  its thick  red  and delicious  i also love the chicken tortilla  full of chicken  cheese  green and red pepppers and topped with crunchy tortilla strips  its great  i am not a fan of chorizo or sausage but ive even chowed down on their soups with sausage     the chef pairs each soup with a piece of bread or pretzel bread from zingermans  another quintessential ann arbor landmark known for its great taste and superior quality  to make your soup the pefect lunch    go to le dog  try their soup and prepare to be stunned by culinary perfection
one of my favorite restaurantsdiners in ann arbor and some of the best korean ive ever eaten  the dol sot bi bim bap  served in a piping hot stone bowl  is awesome and for downtown ann arbor is very moderately priced  i also like that they have two sauces to accompany the bi bim bap  a sweet and a spicy red sauce  both of which are tasty  i like the combo meals as well which include miso soup  two differently prepared meats  rice  and different sides depending on the meal  the teriyaki dishes are good as well  the sushi is mediocre but ultimately the korean food is where this place shines  i lived down the street from this place my senior year of college and used to frequent it quite often  the service was great and the owner also named eric haha was very friendly and even starting occasionally offering me free menu items after regularly eating there for about a year   nice people and good food  what more can you ask for   note teriyaki time is not a sitdown restaurant with waiter service    its fastcasual like chipotle or cosi where you order  pay  and then pick up your food and sit down
this place is great for sushi for those who cant afford to go to a fancy place downtown the sushi is great  every time service has always been good  even when the place is packed ive never had any issues in 4 years and 25 visits will always be first choice for sushi on campus
always a happy customer starting making substitutions in my stir frys to get the perfect one
after my move to michigan  this restaurant became my second family  providing me my home cooked meal often two times a week  i gladly ate there three times in two days a few months ago  haha  recommendations kim chi jiggae with beef  the most flavorful kim chi jiggae ive ever had  its so good  it ruined me to the point that i cant eat this dish at other restaurants  because others taste bland  they also put some ramen in  which is genius  this is for the spicy lovers  im partial to beef  so i always order it   dolsot bi bim bap with beef  a rice dish served sizzling in a hot pot  i ask for double egg  the rice is always perfectly made  crispy on the edges and soft in the middle    kal bi jim  beef soup  comforting    dont recommend kalbi entree  their kalbi is a bit tougher and chewier than other places  id rather go to seoul garden or kangs  soondubu  surprisingly  its just not as savory  note  the restaurant is just one long bar table with stools  so its difficult to go in a big group
amazing  i could live on their bran muffins alone  their bran muffins are completely different from anything ive ever had  theyre not the super sweet light and fluffy kind those are good too  theyre the soft  moist  and slightly heavy kind  restaurants all around the world should serve this instead of their complimentary bread   their eggs benedict is to die for  unlike the popular angelos  their bread base is softer and doesnt cut the roof of my mouth  so thats a good start  their bearnaise sauce is indescribable  i would be tempted to take a taste of my arm if it was served in their bearnaise sauce  maybe  and of course ham which is always my friend  i highly recommend the dish   i also like their corned beef hash which they sometimes serve as their special  its okay  you can play hard to get  ill get you  especially since youre awesome  my experience with their omelettes have been hit or miss  sometimes my omelette is perfect  and sometimes it feel like a watery mess as if it was made with frozen veggies  so i recommend sticking with their consistently delicious eggs benedict
incredible food and even better service from the host to the bartender to the waitress  i was surrounded by friendly  outgoing  accommodating  knowledgable  and interesting people whos main mission was to ensure that i had an enjoyable meal and dining experience they succeeded thanks for a great dinner  oh  and you absolutely must try the botanical best cocktail ive had in a while
absolutely fantastic  one of the best restaurants in the greater boston area for sure   tony maws definitely deserves the james beard award for best new england chef    this restaurant is wonderful for celebrating special events for 2 or grabbing their absolutely fantastic burger at the bar  if you want to sit at a table  i strongly encourage you to make a reservation early  if you want to sit at the bar  then try showing up a few minutes before opening depending on the day    their menu changes daily and every single ingredient comes from local farms every  single  one  they are also big on being environmentally friendly  so they encourage deliveries of produce to the restaurant by bike  etc     although the menu is always changing  you can count on their delicious hamburger to be available and for at least one amazing pork dish they really love pork  let me emphasize this hamburger craigies hamburger is without question the most delicious hamburger i have ever eaten in my entire life  i recommend trying it out sometime at the bar    ive been here for the tasting menu  and it blew me away  i had the ultimateextremetopoftheline tasting menu with my fiancee and we were amazed at the beautiful flavors we experienced  i could not contain my excitement the entire night  every plate was perfectly prepared and lived up to expectations  even the desserts were fabulously tasty and unique  and im not a dessert person    a note about the tasting menu craigie generally does not provide wine pairings for their tasting menus  so you will need to choose the wines yourself or ask your waiter for help  this did not appear to be an issue for my fiancee who generally always has wine with her tasting menus   i havent been to lesplalier or menton yet  but craigie definitely has beaten my experience at no 9 park in case you were contemplating between the restaurants  do your loved one a favor and take them to enjoy a tasting menu at craigie  also do yourself a favor and add yourself to their mailing list so you can reserve a table for special events like the masondixon line dinner the james beard best chef winner for the south east region will be cooking with tony maws
excellent food and excellent service  came here for the first time with my girlfriend and ordered a variety of dishes  here they are     shrimp  chorizo snack good but very strong flavor and spices  not sure if i could eat this as an entire meal  but snack is just the right size     braised oxtail appetizer  must order  this was phenomenal  the serving was almost the size of an entree  make sure to try this dish     cous cous crusted swordfish  excellent  i ordered this entree for myself and it was delicious  i would definitely order it again  the apples really added a nice touch     woodgrilled lamb rack  very good  we ordered mediumrare  but looked more rare than i would have liked  still  the dish was tasty  would order medium next time but thats just me  the waiter was incredibly friendly and suggested some restaurants closer to our apartment  overall a wonderful experience  if you are planning to watch a movie at the nearby kendall cinema  the restaurant has a special theatre menu to get you your food quickly so you can watch your show on time
bondir instantly becomes one of my fave restaurants in boston  i must say the meal was exquisite food was well executed loved the ambience  cozy  intimate great service waiters were extremely knowledgeable and friendly   impressive wine list  09 st urbanshof  oekonomierat nic weis  mosel  germany  riesling as good as it gets smooth  sweet  delicious   its always a good night when the wine is delicious  instead of appetizers  bondir offers half portions of the entrees this allows you try more variaty of their dishes   everything is homemade here  we had   breads 9 grain  the sea  barley flour with hops and summer herbs the sea was awesome  made of seaweed   roasted shallotpistachio tart summer vegetable mignardises  rye berries  herbs  sorrel  mustard oil  toasted pistachio powder  buckwheat rigatoni braised chicken and chanterelle mushroom ragu with lavender  garlic scapes  smoked scamorza this was my fave dish the chicken was amazingly tender  scituate striped bass wax beans  roasted fresh onion  guinea hog prosciutto  burnt tomato pure  bronze fennel seed lavash  red wheat spaghetti cacio e pepe australian perigord truffle  parmigiano  fresh pecorino  long pepper  lychee sorbet  chocolate panna cotta bitter orange mostarda  angelica gel  cocoa nibs and pistachio  i had an amazing night here perfect for 1st date  she will be impressed
loved everything we had worth the hype
so i was really in love with zingermans  and no doubt  zingermans is good stuff but then i thought about it  how realistic is it to pay 15 for a freaking sandwich not very realistic at all the perfect solution is here at maize and blue i think the quality is almost as good as zingermans  and for half the price this place really has a ton of sandwiches  i was reading their sandwich menu board for quite a while i think there are literally over 100 anyway  in the end i got the reuben  and the maize and blue special which consists of turkey  roast beef  some wasabi type mustard  cheese  and the usual veggies wow they were both so good i must also mention that you can get 12 the meat for 125 less i ended up doing this and i cant even imagine what a normal sandwich is  because with 12 the meat  the thing was still overflowing with meat so i guess if you are a big protein kind of person thats perfect for you
oh myfreakingod  so i just moved to a new apt and my roomie had to go out and run some errandsmind you i live in mission hill so i dont have a lot of choices for a quick  cheap and delicious lunch  esp when im super lazy from hauling crap up 4 flights of stairs  so i texted my roomie and asked if she could bring back some lunch anywhere and that i would spot her when she got back  she replied with i took care of it  oh snapppppp crackle and pop how sopranoes i was getting excited i will also just say that when im really hungry i will eat anything even if im supposed to be on a diet lol  when she came backand i unpacked my lil surprise i thought i died and done gone to roast beef heaven  its important to point out that i am not a huge roast beef fan never have been even though we have kelleys roast beef  and mikes roast beef and all the lil joints around i just never liked the way it was cooked the meat was always too red for mebut when i took a bite of this sandwich  all my roast beef fears melted away  it was orgasmic  an explosion of beef in my mouthhahha  the roast beef was cooked and not pink it had lettuce tomatoessome light mayoish sauce and it was on top of fresh baked ciabatta long breadmmmmmmmmmmmm   ive actually never heard of flour or even been there but my roomie swears by iti have found a new lovebeef love  my roomie got a portabello and provolone cheese sandwich she is vegetarian and that looked equally as deliciousshe also bought a slice of portabello and cheese quiche qhich was so warm and cheesy it made me feel all giddy inside  i can only imagine what other goodies they have there and i want to try them all  i am ready to make like beyonce and upgrade u   and step into the actual cafe  who wants to go with me baby are u down down down down down lol  hollah
oh man  the baked goods spread at flour is enough to inspire great  great things and i think it does  everyday everything i have tried has hit the spot muffins  quiche  breakfast sandwiches  poptarts  fruit tarts  i could keep going everything is made from super fresh ingredients  and you can taste it they also are incredibly conscious of dietary restrictions its great for vegetarians  vegans  and glutenfree even the bakery section there menu has enough variety that you can keep going back without getting bored and i do  very oftenthis place is amazing  which is why it is usually packed it is worth every second of what can be a long wait such a gold mine
i walked out of park the other night in stunned silence and suffering the most intense food and beer coma i have ever experienced i had a meal fit for a king or some kind of nobility   walked into park  having heard good things but nothing specific so had zero expectations it was a saturday night and the floor was full  so to the bar we went i honestly think sitting at the bar made the experience all the better to start  the service was incredible every single bartender stopped by to see how we were and to joke around there was a great sense of camaraderie between  not only  the bartenders  but the guests as well   the dcor was incredibly cozy and complimented the elevated farmhouse vibe of the menu  the food and beer was everything ive ever wanted and everything i have ever needed i guess you can call me a beer newb  but my eyes were opened by their awesome selection of beers on tap my friend was in charge of ordering beer and apps she did an amazing job of exploring the beer list but her choice of app was the only meh moment of the meal she ordered the chicken wings  which dont get me wrong  were good however  compared to everything else  they were just okay for my entree  i obviously got the daily meat pie how could you put a meat pie in front of my face and expect me not to choose it that day it was braised chicken something with red wine sauce and mushrooms it was a huge portion and i did some serious damage to it i cant wait to go back and see how they change it up my friend got the bar steak which was really quite amazing overall  the food was pretty close to perfect at least for my palate well done  park
wowie i got a grilled chicken  avacado  jicama sandwich and it was so tasty everything was very fresh the chocolate cupcake was fantastic the cake had dare i say an almost perfect texture  i didnt try any drinks  but somebody in front of me in line got a latte and it certainly looked delicious  the place has a very comfortable atmosphere  with people together at tables studying and talking all the staff members i encountered were super friendly and welcoming the music was perhaps a little bit loud for reading or doing work  its not cheap  but its certainly worth every penny
this is an awesome starbucks the staff is really friendly and they always make an effort to get to know their customers they are also very knowledgeable about the different coffees they serve on the clover which i highly recommend trying sometimes the line is out the door but it always moves fast  the store is very spacious for a boston store  and has a lot of comfortable chairs for sitting with your friends or studying the outdoor patio is great on warm sunny days  definitely one of the best starbucks stores ive been to in the boston area
eatin at hungry mother in cambridge was such a singular culinary experience for me  its like nothing ive ever tasted  and damn expensive too  but delicious  and i thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs  the one scallop that they give you shouldnt be plural on the menu  the pot of caramel  the pork shoulder  the pulled pork sandwich with fried onions  the nacho cheese tasting pimento cheese sandwich  the buttery collared greens  gnocchi  and all the drinks  especially the nonalcoholic ones  dad  if youre reading this    catfish is ok here the orange thousand islandy sauce is tasty  but im not sure if id order it again  i wasnt that into the hash  and the pickled cauliflower was a bit wack  maybe i just wasnt expecting that particular combination of flavors  its probably an acquired taste    great date place too  nothing like dim lighting and a picture of thomas jefferson to get you in the mood  i went here on halloween  and the host was workin a little rascals alfalfa costume  wicked    the pear ice cake is really good  but its just a block of ice cream with pear in it covered with chocolate  and lacks the delicacy of the other desserts  hey  if youre into that  go for it  overall  i was going to write off my kendall square food expedition as a bust until i dined here  thanks mama
love   pastries  scones  bread  sandwiches  everything is so yum  my favorites are the sticky buns duh  cheddar scallion scone  banana bread  and tomato mozzarella pesto pocket  it was hard to narrow it down to fourmake it five  breakfast sandwich is also divine  now i know everyone has probably said all the wonderful things there may be to say  but i want to specifically gush about how sweet the people at flour were for my bakery order i placed to bring back the goodies to texas  apparently  one of my uncles goes to church with joannes parents  my mom  my aunt  and another uncle read about flour in the newspaper you know how the story goes suddenly  i get flooded with calls and emails two days before i come back to texas can you please bring me the famous sticky bun  banana bread  pain aux raisin  scone  what is better can i try them all     i called ahead asking if i could place an order for some of the pastries  and they were really patient with me  gave me suggestions for what was goodnot good for traveling  instructions to heat up certain items  etc  i even had to call back to add more items to each of the boxes when i picked the goodies up the next day  they had split my boxes up accordingly and everything was right i was having trouble keeping straight what i needed  but luckily they were on top of it  after 6 hours of travel  security scanning  bumping against oblivious travelers  and accidentally kicking the boxes when under the airplane seat in front of me  all the pastriesscones remained intact somehow  there was barely any movement  and everything looked almost as good as in the store   i would eat here every day if only i also ran 20 milesday to keep up with the calories yum
hands down  my boyfriend and my favorite bar in boston  besides being an awesome neighborhood bar  the food is also amazing  the pork quesadilla and white bean dip are appetizer favorites  the boy loves everything standouts for him are the meatloaf burger and reuben sandwiches  and i love the roasted vegetable sandwich  they all come with a side of either pasta salad  roasted potatoes  mixed greens  or chips    great place to go chill  work  catch the games  relax  or drink up  in fact  i am sitting here at the bar working right now  homey  cozy  friendly  what more can you ask for
the food and baked goods are so good and i think that the best complement i have for this place is that it was literally the first food i had after having my baby  i had been going through a period of intense flour sticky bun cravings for a few weeks and happened to have a sticky bun sitting on my counter at home waiting for me when i went into labor i had to leave it at home and my sister  who was visiting  ended up eating it  i knew this would happen i mused sitting in my hospital bed  so my dear dear husband surprised me with a selection of flour sandwiches and sticky buns for lunch after i had finished the business of having a baby thus making a memorable event even more memorable
i read the reviews out of curiosity and then remembered it has been waaay too long since my last visit to cuchi cuchi walk in and be instantly charmed by the art deco glam craziness  oh and the excellent food and drinks  the tuna tartaravocado mousse cornets are mind blowing it is a bit expensive but the more people in your group the better to sample all the dishes i came here one night with about 10 people and i think we got one of everything off the menu and it was all great the brie en croute is the stuff dreams are made of
by far the best thai food in cambridge  most negative reviews on ylep are from people who got takeout or delivery  thai food has to be eaten right away  so of course those of your who ate the food at home were less than pleased this place is excellent and comes close to what you get in thailand close only  because well never get the fresh thai seafood and veggies over here  so  they messed up a delivery to your company or perhaps  it was you  and they didnt beg for your patronage the fact is  they dont need you as a customer because this place freakin rocks  if you actually go to the restaurant  the staff are efficient and courteous  they dont fawn over you  but why does that matter i go out to restaurants to eat good food  not to get my ego stroked
yelp reviews are interesting  because they prove that you cant please everyone all the time  and i am puzzled by some of the negative reviews  we felt that bondir was spectacular  i can endorse the vast majority of the reviews that are glowing i hesitate to write this review because it is so small and pleasant  and i am worried that i wont be able to come here as often as i plan in the future  the service was warm and pleasant  and we felt like we had been invited into a home the food was uniformly wonderful  with fresh vegetables that were perfectly prepared the scallops were outstanding  and pasta dish was also lovely there arent a lot of dessert selections but they were all tasty  when i got up to leave  i glanced around as i put my coat on almost everyone at the other tables glanced back and smiled  and i think it is because they were enjoying their dinner i am a bald middleage guy  so it wasnt because of my looks  if you are looking for the steak house or huge servings with mashed potato experience  bondir is not the place you wont get 2300 calories in one sitting at bondir thank heaven but if you want fresh  interesting and delightful food  its the place for you before we even got home  wed made plans by email to go again our best friends  and i am planning on eating there every chance i get
totally great place wonderful food  polite service  fantastic desserts as a veggie diner  it is perfect i have eaten there 4 times in the past two weeks  and it was terrific every time two types of veggie burgerboth good regular fries are delicious they get a bit confused on service sometimes  but give them a break  they are new they are trying hard and very friendly this is my favorite place for lunch in cambridge  and a good place for dinner  too my only suggestion is that they need sweet potato fries
i love this place it is not pretentious but the food is always solid the lobster risotto is wonderful and the service is great ive eaten here 5 times and havent been disappointed yet
solid and consistent chinese foodi have been eating here routinely for many years an outstanding bargain i am chinese and grew up on home cooked chinese food  and this is authentic and reliable for a great price
its always a good sign from the brunch gods when the first thing to arrive at your table after the water is a basket of sticky buns  coffee cake  lemon poppy muffins  and savory baconcheese scones  and when said sticky buns taste like butter draped in caramel  and you can literally taste the sour cream oozing out of the coffee cakeits pretty much guaranteed that you are in for a treat  the hits just kept on coming when my eggs benedict with pancetta and a side of red roasted potatoes arrived  the english muffin was nicely toastey and buttery  the bacon was crisp and salty  the eggs were perfectly poached  and the hollandaise was not too thick  the potatoes needed a little bit of salt  but were otherwise tender and made a nice vehicle to soak up the runny egg yolks and extra sauce  for dessert my friend and i split the french toast  which was 3 fluffy  buttery triangles of clearly deepfried brioche  bathed in a caramel sauce with sliced bananas  candied pecans  and a dollop of mascarpone cheese  i dont really think i need to say any more than that  amazing  they had a short list of inventive breakfast cocktails that go beyond the traditional mimosa or bellini  mine was called hits of sunshine and consisted of champagne with raspberry puree and elderflower liquer  which was tart  flowery  and refreshing  my friends passionfruit  honey liquer  and champagne concoction was the winner though  with its sweet taste and velvety texture  the atmosphere was quirky  lively  and sunny at least in the monday club room  where we sat  the carpets are leopardprint  the walls are magenta  or green if youre by the bar  you feel a bit like youre at the mad hatters tea party  but in a good way  its nice to eat at a restaurant that is serious about good food  but a little more lighthearted about everything else
the food is good  the drinks are excellent and expensive  but the reason i went to noir at least once a week all summer long was to relax on the outdoor patio with a martini and a cigarette late at night and do some quality people watching and gossiping with my good friend and noir is an excellent venue for such things
i have had nothing but excellent service and food every time i have eaten here the food is amazing sometimes it is so good that i have to go outside for some fresh air during my meal so i can regroup and go back in to finish it the real upstairs is where i prefer to sit  but downstairs is good too ive also been to upstairs on the square for wine tasting and to the bar for drinks  all of which have been great experiences
we had the best time here the other night the place is adorable there are so many rooms  you really feel as though you are in someones house there is also a bar area  a private room  and a patio that is perfect for a warm night the service was excellent the food was delicious the prices were great and  parking karma was on our side in harvard square this is the perfect date spot or the perfect place to get together with friends or the perfect place to take your parents if they come to visit  the bread and the variety of olives they start you off with are delicious its a really hearty wheat bread and a raisin bread i didnt try   we also started off with a perfect bottle of wine   we all got appetizers one had the special softshell crab  another had mushroom phyllo  and i had the special californian mission figs wrapped in prosciuotto we all shared and mine was the clear winner  we all ordered half portions of pasta dishes i love that they offer halves so we could have apps  save room for dessert  one had the special of the day  pasta with a bolognese sauce of veal and lamb another had the shrimp linguine and i had the linguini con carciofi and i added grilled shrimp it was probably one of the best pasta dishes i have ever had and i live in the north end the sauce was perfect and light and the flavors of the artichoke hearts  tomatoes  garlic  shrimp  arugula  red pepper worked perfectly together    for dessert we split a key lime pie amazing and a vanilla cake topped with fruit and cream i forget the name both were delicious and we finished every bite    it was our first time at the red house but we will definitely go back my boyfriend and his mother remembered paul the owner from his gianninos days so  his mom was able to pop into the kitchen on our way out to say hi to him  which made her very happy
if you like authentic chinese food like me  you will love this place   i am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here i guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and americanized food i never tried the americanized dishes but the chinese ones are decent i always just order their specials  which are listed on the first page of their menu  my favorite dishes are  chinese style mapo tofu   beijing duck you need to order it ahead   fish with the spicy sauce the spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers it has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug    and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots
dear ashleys   thanks for the beer  obviously its incredible  moreso  thank you for not shoving a big ol fuckin tv at the end of the table if i wanted to drink beer and watch tv  i wouldnt have left the house  and appreciate the fact that you want me and my friends to actually hang out with each other  sorry for blowing up your bathroom last tuesday  not my intention  see you soon  love   jerry
i struck up conversation with the guy behind the meat counter for about ten minutes  nicest guy in the world  and took the time to tell me any  everything about every meat under the counter   turns out it was the owner i cant tell you how impressed and proud i am to have this in my community
the same owner of baraonda  then real italian food   its my favourite the wine is awesome  you can find everything you want tagliere di formaggi and tagliere di salumi or affettati  i dont remember are delicious  the best i have ever found in atl i think this restaurant is even better than a lot of italian restaurant in italy   the place is really nice  but small its more expensive than baraonda  but not so much  this restaurant is advised by an italian person 
its an italian market food comes from italy  its like shopping in my country unfortunately they dont have a lot of products  but they have delicious meats raw ham  speck  ham  salami    i usually go there for lunch on saturday  trying their great panini and i shop there a lot  if you like italian food and wine  you should try toscano
i am so glad i got to try this place out it was so packed but so worth it i ordered a slaw dog  a chili cheese dog omgawhh delish we also got onion rings and chili cheese fries my mom got a double cheeseburger  a side salad  everything was really good
bomb cookies for a cheap price cant get any better then that  except  parking sucks  theres usually always a long line
situated on a quite street of midtown neighborhood  ecco is quite different from its neighboring eateries it advertises a european menu and stands up to it fairly well  ecco has a small patio area for outside seating and fairly big inside seating area we went there for late dinner on saturday evening so avoided any waiting time but the place was still fairly busy at 10pm   they have an decent selection on import beers and fairly wide selection on wines food is delicious however the portions were european if you are looking for copious amounts of food  this is probably not the right place fried goat cheese was ridiculous good and lives to its hype we also ordered couple of orders of cheese and they were served at room temperature  uncut the proper way surprising number of places including wine bars get this basic serving etiquette wrong also  i strongly recommend their woodfire grill pizza its thin  crispy and goes very well with their toppings of cured meats   ecco is fairly priced and their menu is well thought its definitely worth a visit
ignore the slightly tacky decor this place is yummy and fast  we got a 30  some noodles  rice  egg role app  and split a thai tea    we were full and everything was really tasty service was good too  even while they were really busy   2332 plus tip awesome
in haiku  its cheap and yummy i mix in peanut butter cups always satisfies
visiting uw wthe bf since he graduated from there  this place is pretty close to campus  thanks for the buttons  alex
i really love this place i knew of it for many years before i actually tried it  and have been back several times since the serversstaff are warm  friendly  and attentive but dont hover the food is delicious  great naan and love their tikka masala and standard vegetable side they also make a delicious aioli theyve accepted coupons graciously when weve had them
i just love them  its a great place to meet someone over coffee or just do homework the spicy and creamy chai here are my favorite a frequent hangout spot for my husband and me latenight they close at midnight  bummer but just glad that they are open after 9 pm
karas cupcakes are really good  they are unique in that the frosting is not crazily sweet like in other cupcake places such as sprinkles  highly recommend not to go there  their cakes are good and moist  frostings are soft and smooth  plus their cupcakes are so cute  ive had a number of flavors there  meyer lemon  chocolate velvet  rasberry chocolate and the passionfruit  all are very yummy  im a chocolate lover so chocolate velvet is my favorite
i had been invited to this place on more occasions than i can remember  my response to each invite upon hearing this was not only a vegetarian restaurant but a vegan one was an adamant no thanks   finally a pretty enough girl invited me along thank you gamze and i could not say no    my eyes my friends were opened that dayscream it from the rooftops vegan food can be goodnot only good but freakin incredible  i love this place the food was so amazing i instantly forgot i wasnt eating meatdidnt even cross my mind that hey there is not meat in this dish just straight up amazing food    as katie o saysfood so good even carnivores will love it  ill drink to that
is it ok if i like it just because i think its fin delicious    i promise im not trying to be trendyi just think it tastes grrreat
oh gyros of aladdin falafel corner  how i love thee seriously  this is as good as gyros can get at a very good price their gyros is at the right temperature  the meat is juicy and flavorful it just all works its one of those places that you walk by and lures you inside with its yummygyros aromas i find this place irresistible  and you will too
this is seriously my new favorite place to eat in the udistrict  their food is deeeelish  the lamb roti is to die for along with paratha  which is kind of like a combination of a flour tortilla and naan  their sorrel drink  a flowerytasting drink  is especially good with the food and goes along with the spices of the food  my mouth is watering from just even thinking about it  the service is a bit slow but friendly  try it  d
you wont miss the meat i promise  this place is so good  every time i go here i leave about five pounds heavier  i just love drenching my whole plate with their delicious peanut sauce  the only downside  this must be the place to bring your kids because little rascals are running around wild everywhere  i mean rice everywhere
id like to take this place behind the bleachers and get it pregnant  only in my dreams  but seriously  i adore this place  thai tom is home to the best peanut sauce ever made and ive consumed a lot of peanut sauce  i highly recommend any dish featuring the delicious liquid gold  the trick here is to go for lunch or slightly before the dinner crowd because it can get crazy  another good bet is to order to go but be prepared to wait 3045 minutes during peak times  there are some adorable shops across the street to kill some time  and dont forget  cash only  dang it  now im hungry again
delicious food  really nice people  okay coffee  but a major reason to go is the giant portions of frozen yogurt the yogurt is on the tart side which makes it particularly refreshing in summer  and if you have it for here it comes in a tulip shaped sundae glass which feels oldfashioned and somewhat luxurious decor is sort of unpretentious indiecraftacularesque
thanh vi has the nicest people running it that you could ever hope to meet their banh mi is excellent as are their salad rolls im so into the banh mi i find it hard to go without it even for a single visit  but they have many other dishes
handsdown the best dosas ive eaten in seattle its homestyle cooking at its best not too oily or buttery  crisp and with really good  spicy chutney the sambar was a adequate  i guess  but overall awesome food as many of the other reviews mentioned  the place is essentially a minimart  but instead of all the liquor fridges at the back  they have a few plastic tables neighborhood is a bit skeevy as well  and with all the muggings going on in that area recently  id be careful at night
the raven grill grows on you  reliable  healthy assuming you dont order the delicious fried seafood items menu at a moderate price  raven has become a go to place for an informal dinner out in the neighborhood  service has been prompt and attentive during recent visits  they do not take reservations  but they do maintain a call ahead list which helps to keep the wait time down
four stars or five stars it was a close call pretty much i had an amazing first experience at benjys and it may very well be a new favorite of mine i think it is actually so i finally visited benjys after hearing so much about their happy hour  from reviews and it being a yelp drinks destination visiting their happy hour was the best decision ever it was very cool the restaurant has a nice set up with the loungy bar upstairs and the patio i came for happy hour and was sure i would order some food off their appetizer menu  i ended up trying the asian chicken salad and the blood orange margarita the margarita was good  my memory is a little clouded of the specifics of that actually but i absolutely loved my salad my favorite food happens to be chinese chicken salad and ive been looking all over houston for a good salad the only place ive found thus far is cpk i love cpks salads anyways  back to benjys the asian chicken salad was amazing the flavor of the chicken was a little smokey but perfect the salad had the right amount of crunchiness and the dressing was perfect the salad was big  so big that i struggled eating the last few bites i was so full  pretty much it was amazing but what was even better  my server  who im sure was a manager when taking my order he could tell that i wanted to try the calamari but he told me it was big so i decided not to order it because he said the salad was big too welp  when he brought out my food  he brought me a little bowl of calamari too so i could try it so the service gets five stars from me  benjys i shall be back soon
i love this place   the chicken is great  they have plantains and black beans florida staples which should be everywhere and nothing is greasy and gross like most other places   i dont mind paying a little more for this place seeing as everything seems so fresh and delicious  plus  dont miss their salsasauce bar
this is my new favorite place i absolutely love the nachos here after finding out they have 2 draughts all day everyday and that theyre open until 2am with a full bar  i will be hanging out here for drinks on the weekend in the near future great food  location and prices
i came here during the fourth of july weekend in 2009 i walked in friday night with my brother about 1030pm and ended up leaving probably about 430am because we were talking to the bartender learning the history of the chili parlor and austin this was easily the best time ive ever had at a bar as a tourist and have never felt more welcome   we ended up back here everyday of our stay 4 days and received the same great service and welcome feeling from the entire staff the manager even gave us suggestions for live music suiting our tastes  good venues  directions and other bartenders to talk to   another thing that brings lots of character and conversation to this place is the fact it was used in a movie and the events that led up to and included the filming of the tarantino movie death proof they even sport the green booze from the movie   in addition to the awesome history and staff  the food is amazing i think i tried just about everything on the menu over those 4 days and loved everything i was served the white chili stands out most in my mind as well as the enchiladas   i highly suggest checking out this little hole in the wall  you wont regret it
im hooked on this place  we were actually going next door to chicken kitchen when we stumbled upon nam the other day when it was kinda chilly outside i saw pho and thought something soup like would be perfect   for starters  we tried the crabtons which even the antiseafood companion thought was very good i had the unphogettable which i absolutely loved  and want to rename the phoking awesome antiseafood companion had the chicken avenger and was also quite happy with the order   the staff was very eager to offer assistance while ordering and seemed thoroughly happy to be there   i guess the best way to put this into words of how much i liked this place the day after eating dinner here  i was bringing coworkers in to try it out for lunch they too agreed we found a new place to have lunch on a consistent basis which we all enjoyed
i love retro  old hollywood glamour  small plates and theme parties  so this year i decided to have a roaring 20s themed birthday dinner at cuchi cuchi we may have dressed the part a little and some boas might have shown up  but we fit right in we were transported back in time as soon as we walked in super cute decor with dim lighting and fabulous music they didnt take reservations at the time we wanted to go  so a group of eight of us planned to meet at the bar for some drinks   even though the place was packed the bartender was attentive and helped select our cocktails they have so many options with cute names and fresh muddled ingredients it was hard to pick just one of course  i settled on the alicat after some indecision  since thats one of my nicknames we also tried the blackberry cosmo and a few others i cant remember the names of i was starving so we also ordered a few small plates  the fried artichoke hearts and prosciutto wrapped melon they were delish the wait was about an hour since we had a larger group and it was a saturday night  but we had fun chatting at the bar and the time flew by   once we were seated i tried the somelikeithot for my next cocktail  a spicy martini with olives that was awesome my friend ordered some of her fave small plates to get us started garlic shrimp and brie en croute  and then we continued to sample as much as we could including the deep fried tomato  seafood stuffed avocado  cuban cigar short ribs wrapped in dough  grilled skirt steak  potato gratin  marinated mushrooms  deep fried zucchini  lamb  puff pastry bites  salad and probably something i am forgetting my faves were definitely the artichokes  brie  the cuban cigar and the skirt steak   our waitress was so sweet  and handled our crazy loud table effortlessly plus she recommended the skirt steak which makes her even more fab and the waitresses get to dress in 20s attire  which is so fun it made me want to work there lucky for you though since i might not be the best waitress i will stick to just stepping back in time for an evening of cocktails or dinner  which ill be doing again real soon
first of all  you have to take it as it is cheap college food so given that  if you want some foie grois  this place isnt for you but if you want some food thats worth every cent  this is the place like everyone else  i must recommend the special carne asada or the nachos try to hit it up when its not crowded  so come for an early lunch opens at 11 i think or a late dinner closes at 1 its small  so take your food back to your dorm  apt  frat house  whatever and their salsa and chips hit the spot too  so yummo  as a starving student  your belly will be the only thing youre busting  not your wallet 
i am surprised at the ratings of this place although ive been only once and did not care much for the service its somewhat difficult to order in spanish  since i am asian  but for the californian who misses innout  this place is for you stick with a cheeseburger and fries  but the fish sandwich looks moderately awesome as well but yeah  this burger is as close as ive gotten to innout  and ive been looking  ketchup is the devils condiment thats why its red dont kill your burger with it
did anyone else read how opal mehta got kissed  got wild and got a life  you know  the book written by a harvard freshman a couple years ago but was quickly taken off the market because it turned out to contain whole paragraphs plagiarized from another authors books anyway  at the end of that book  the heroine finally achieves her dream of getting accepted by harvard  and finds herself sitting at bartleys with a group of fellow john harvards as she bites into her george bush burger  cheesy grease and bbq sauce drip down her chin  and she is filled with happiness beyond anything she had ever experienced reading that  i knew that i  too  wanted to eat at bartleys  in the spirit of the 2004 elections  i ordered the john kerry burger he voted this the best burger before he voted against it   a swiss cheese burger with mushrooms  tomato  lettuce  and fries it was amazing total love at first bite the meat was tender and juicy  and the whole thing was cheesy  savory  and deliciously greasy a few bites in  my chin was dripping with meat juice and ketchup and chunks of halfchewed mushrooms  my attractiveness might have been at an all time low  but id never been happier it was a truly transcendental burger experience thank you  opal mehta  ina k put it best when she said this place is an institution granted  she was talking about a completely different restaurant in a different state  but still  the words fit a boston landmark since 1960 im sad to see it go  update apparently the close is temporary there was a kitchen fire  and the place is only closed until they repair the damage phew
royal east is the place to go  if youre looking for a nice yet inexpensive lunch or if youre taking a group out to dinner  this place on the corner of windsor and main street in cambridge is where you want to be  the food is always fresh and has a nice mix of southernchinese authenticity and americanized taste so its perfect for those wanting a little more than chinese takeout    if youre on the adventurous side  you can always order the specials on the menu  or try the squab youll have to order it a day in advance so they can get the bird  if youre craving even more authentic chinese food  or if southern chinese is just not your thing  you can always go down the street to mary chung in central square  ever since i discovered this place my freshman year of college  ive always come to royal east for comfort food  what i get when im trying to settle down before finals or after a long day  shrimp stuffed eggplant with black bean sauce  its even better for lunch because for 7 bucks  you get the entree  rice  and a bowl of soup  the waiters are friendly  speak both mandarin and cantonese if youre into that  and will always keep your teapot and water glass freshened  come here with groups too royal east is awesome when you order family style  and they have the rotating tray for the food at the bigger group tables  in short  come here for a nice mix of cantonese authenticity and oldschool chinese flavor  and order the shrimp stuffed eggplant d  oh yeah  they deliver for free too if you order more than 25  below that  its 3 to deliver
the burgers are good  the shakes are heavenly i enjoyed a dick cheney just a heartbeat away which is a delicious homecooked style burger with bacon and a side of baked beans everything about it was delicious the side was a bit small  but still good ya  the burgers are a bit pricey  but they are the best in boston without a doubt  the milkshake was hands down the best ive had in boston i had a chocolate and it was everything i ever dreamed of it was fairly cheap too  especially considering the likes of jp licks which is good  but empties your wallet  the seating arrangements are a bit odd  but it fits in with the whole feel of the place also its cash only so hit up the atm first theres always a line on the weekend  and they dont do reservations  so just stand in line outside
i can completely understand some of the negative reviews here personally  i think this is the best pizza ive ever had  beware  during the rush hour  this place gets insanely busy  you have to place your order at the barwith a waitress before sitting and there isnt a wide variety of options pizza  subs  meatballs  sausage and salads  otherwise  the pizza is amazing  the beer is cheapish  wait staff is friendly and parking is easiest in princeton  great for big groups  children  happy hour  sports  but not so much for a quiet or intimate dinner  overall  i absolutely love this place and regular about once a week  did i mention the pizza
best pizza  period delicious thin crust best pepperoni my personal favorite is the pepperoni and garlic comboi always end up eating pretty much half a pie nothing compares i want some now   only problem is they have a very small wait staff  so when tables need to be cleared  drinks need to be refilled  or checks need to be given  thats when one experiences a lag sadly this can be problematic as the pizza is rather salty  so drinks need to be refilled quickly other than that and the long lines  but if you know to be prepared  its not that bad  its 5 stars all the way
love lucys they also opened a restaurant in rocky hill 113  i think  great sandwiches  fresh pasta and sauces large selection of dishes to choose from for take out and reheat for dinner  there will be a long line for the lunch crowd  the line moves rather quickly and its worth the wait
huge supporter of local farms and local businesses  fresh fresh produce  when in season veggies and fruits are picked that very day you may even be able to pick your own  organic section  free range eggs  local farm and supporter of other local  nj businesses  the staff is always extremely helpful and friendly    pick your own with events every weekend in october  they sell turkeys for thanksgiving and their own pies christmas trees for christmas time  open all year  including thanksgiving morning  a great trip for the entire family
this place always entices me with its siren song of exotic ice cream and sorbet flavors whenever i am near today was unseasonably warm  and after a 40mile bike ride down to princeton  i hit bent spoon in a mediterranean kindof mood  where i sampled the heady turkish coffee ice cream  and the tangy greek yogurt ice cream with candied walnuts  which was fabulous  i pedaled away  holding the cup in one hand  and the handlebar in the other  shoving the ice cream into my face i momentarily lost my balance  and the tiny cup slipped from my fingers horrified  i juggled it in slow motion  but it fell to the ground  landing upside down in the street i abruptly dismounted  held up my arms to stop traffic  picked it up  scraped a few black particles off the ice cream with my fingernail  and resumed eating it no way was i going to waste that
abc is one of a kind unless the kind is corner brewery   they have great beers here and i love going to the bar and getting a few samples  working down the list at 4oz per serving is a great way to sample the beer while snacking on some food  good vegetarian choices and the pear  walnut salad is great
i love mani  sometimes the dishes may be hit or miss  but they are at least attempting to think outside the box  and sometimes they go way outside of it    the pickled cherry tomatoes are definitely worth trying for the experience of the sweet vinegary flavor explosion you get when you bite into them  love the ice less water in the table  nothing irks me more than drinking water filled with ice cubes    decent wine selection    will be back
ok  so it might not be the best pho  ramen  tempura udon but eat here once and youll wonder why anyone would go to the noodles  company around the corner  we seem to end up there once a week and were always happy  i happen to think that their japanese dishes are their strongest suit  which isnt surprising considering its called tomukun   try the tomukun ramen  if nothing else  i also like the tempura udon even though the broth lacks a little finesse  the tempura items are nicely executed  duck ramen is nice and hearty  their phos are good though  to be honest  we love saigon garden and we feel a little guilty everytime we have pho at tomukun  our favorite appetizers are the dumplings  none of us are willing to share  so we each order our own not a big deal at their prices  service has always been good  lunch or dinner  quiet or busy  all around  its a fun  reasonable restaurant and always yummy  were huge fans
mani is the best new restaurant in the area  food is fresh and flavorful  staff is kind and decor is eclectic and visually stimulating    the beet appetizer was perfectly prepared  and i had to hold myself back from ordering another  this dish is a musthave for any beet lover  pistachio pizza was a pleasant surprise  and the word pizza does this gem no justice  the cheese was thinly dispersed over flat  crispy dough and there was more focus on toppings pistachios  onions and a touch of rosemary  yum    dessert was vanilla gelato with espresso poured over top  and it was my absolute favorite part of the meal  i would highly recommend this for anyone who isnt crazy about the classic sweet treat  as the gelato and espresso compliment each other perfectly and keeps the flavor of sugar down to a minimum  when you decide to dine at mani  be sure to call ahead and get your name on the list to avoid a long wait
the best quality and variety of meat in the area  period plus  they will happily track down hard to find items for you  like deboned quail or huge quantities of veal bones for stock and  the guys behind the meat counter couldnt be more friendly and helpful yes  youll pay through the nose  but i have no problem doing so for high quality and a great experience theres no better place to wander around and be inspired to put together a delicious meal
id been avoiding grange after reading some fairly tepid reviews here  and now im kicking myself for missing out on this gem of a restaurant both food and service were outstanding last night we started with the charcuterie plate  including generous portions of lardo  the heavenly cured pork backfat  terrific chicken liver and duck pts  and a turkey sausage that was the only just ok moment of the evening pickled vegetables and a beet compote were an excellent foil for all the fatty goodness then  the beet salad with goat cheese was simple and delicious  followed up by two stellar entres i opted to follow pork fat with more pork fat  choosing the pork belly with braised turnips fabulous my husband had what i consider the litmus test for any cook or restaurant roast chicken granges was just what it should be moist  flavorful  with crunchycrisp skin  and delicious baconyfried brussels sprouts to go with we ended with the cheese plate  which included surprisingly complex michigan cheddar and manchego plus a tangy fresh goat cheese  as we were finishing up  the table next to us began receiving their selections from the snacks menu even though we were stuffed  we were jealously eyeing their scotch duck eggs and chorizo  date and blue cheese bites and planning a return visit
wow we just had a fantastic dinner at logan we had had lunch there shortly after it opened several years ago and i had been underwhelmed by the limited lunch menu and the food shame on me for judging a new restaurant by its lunch menu  ive missed many amazing dinners here as a result everything on the menu sounded fantastic  and there are many choices the dinner started out nicely with a tasty potatoleekfennel pollen soup as an amusebouche i had the green papaya salad  which is like a party in your mouth we both had the veal breast as an entree it was unctuous and succulent and absolutely delicious  as were the cranberry beans that accompanied it the biscuits were light and tender and i could have eaten the entire plate of them myself i skipped dessert  but my husband said the poached pear spring roll was fantastic im looking forward to getting loose in the app and pasta sections of the menu on a return visitthe crispy sweetbreads  tapenade gnocchi and wild boar bolognese unfortunately  they had run out of it the night we were there are calling my name   the restaurant is cozy and comfortable and service by larry was outstanding also  we had known kevin  one of the ownersthe guy who runs the front of the housesommelier  from his days at five lakes grill in milford  and even though we hadnt seen him for years  he remembered exactly what we used to drink there  impressive in addition to being a great host  he really knows his food and wine logan has an excellent wine list and will steer you in the right direction on both if you ask
im now in love with manis food and vibe enough to say woohoo  but i do have to qualify my excitement by noting that at normal dinner hours people are packed in 23 deep at the bar waiting for tables  and waiting a long time and  theres no way for groups of fewer than 6 to avoid the wait since mani only accepts reservations for 6 this is really annoying and deterred us for a long time  until we stopped by for an early dinner before the crowds arrived  but  enough negativity the food makes up for the obnoxious waits and reservation policy i love the small plates way of eating  and every dish we had was a knockout the pork belly was maybe the best ive had so soft and unctuous they serve it with a spoon  but with a crispy  salty crust divine also stellar was the charred octopus  tasting simply of octopus but with a punch of lemon  and the onspecial pasta with braised pork the prosciutto and arugula pizza was delicious with a nicely crispy crust i was impressed by the many interesting yet simple pizza topping combinations and will surely be back to try others they also have a reasonablypriced but small wine list with some hardtofind choices  manis decor and atmosphere are modern but warm  and though many of the staff look like they could be toocoolforschool hipsters  everyone was gracious and efficient
amazing food i like that the menu is small this means everything is fresh  the cheese steak is lemme put it this way  your philly friends will approve the flavor is right  the bread is tender and fresh  and the ribeye is so tasty  7 bucks for cheese steak or korean food is really cheap the portions are big too i love this place  for lunch or dinner i usually get the bim bim bop  japchae  or sun dun boon   try their soups i know the names might be unfamilar  but on a rainy or cold day  it really warms the soul it reminds me of moms home cooking im not korean  but i can still see the care that went into the preparation of their meals  the atmosphere is very casual which is much appreciated in an increasingly gentrified ann arbor  no fancy attire needed the owner and his wife are wonderful people they were so welcoming and inviting to their guests i asked mr sim if he opened on sunday and he said no  we rest and watch a korean drama show  lol  the owners are such humble and sweet people they dont hire any help and its literally the two of them working all day long if you want to support local businesses  it doesnt get any more local than this
flat out  mani osteria is amazing this place sets the standard by which other restaurants in ann arbor should be judged whenever i go somewhere else  i ask myself  sure  this place is good  but is it mani good   sure  sometimes it is hard to get a table here  but it is well worth it mani makes amazing pizza by new york standards i would rate its pizza as being comparable to co in nyc link httpwwwyelpcombizconewyork   all of the food here is delicious but the pizzas are outstanding  lovely thin crust pizzas with heavenly bubbly burnt bits on the outer crust they know what they are doing in that kitchen also  for my beerdrinking friends out there  they have a nice selection of beer  featuring rotating taps of michigan beers good wines are also available ive heard although i cant attest to that as kendall jackson is good enough for me in that domain   the staff is incredibly attentive and there are lots of them at first glance  it appears the place is overstaffed however  all of them are hard at work  attending to everyones needs and overall  making your experience great none of them are standing idly by waiting for something to do the whole seeminglyoverstaffed bunch is working hard  which translates well for guests   noteworthy ive been here four times now  and there hasnt been a bad pie  nor a bad experience  in the bunch that is significant while yelp allows reviews that are updates of a place  those review are few and far between so  most of the reviews that go into star ratings are of peoples first experiences  which we are mostly positivelybiased ive been here four times and each time it has been fantastic that goes a long way for speaking to how consistently great this place is   protip come for lunch  the weekday happy hour  or a sunday dinner  as its much easier to get a table then on fridays and saturdays the place is packed  and it can be near impossible to get a table within an hour   all in all  mani is just amazing all of the elements of this place come together in an amazing experience of great food and great times this is my standby place to go to when i want great pizza in a city with poor pizza options and  even more  mani is my standby place to go to get a great meal in a city with amazing food options   take home point if you havent been to mani yet  you havent yet had the best food in ann arbor
excellent crepes  good  strong coffee  fair service  tough to beat we havent tried the rest of the menu yet  but i have no reason to believe it is any less stellar   probably the best brunch food weve had in a2  and among the best ive ever had even with the weekend crowds  we got a table in 20 min no reservations and were served promptly
i find that i have less to say about the places i like the best   the atmosphere was very comfortable the staff was accommodating and attentive the food pizza  pappardelle  fig and gorgonzola salad was all fresh  with rich flavors  but light on the stomach the price was a bit high but i felt ok about paying it because i couldnt think of any way they could have done better   my background is italian so i am a pretty tough critic of italian food  but this is probably the best ive found in a2 and a strong contender even when compared to larger cities
food 55  service 55  a refreshing change to the ann arbor scene
food 55 service 55 destination deli and local fav  not to be missed
i love diddy riese their business plan is brilliant you can customize your ice cream and cookies to make an ice cream sandwich  you can get a customizable shaved ice id recommend the passion fruit syrup  pineapple and strawberry with the vanilla ice cream or just buy cookies cookies are freshly baked they are soft  and slightly chewy all of this with the price tag of about 2 bucks if you havent tried this place out and you have a sweet tooth  you should definitely try it out tips bring cash line is always out the door sometimes with really annoying young drunk freshman sloos who are annoying so be prepared
omgeeee this place was great i got the chicken bacon ranch salad salad  lame i know and it was so good the chicken was fresh  juicy and seasoned to perfection  the portion was huge prices are modest i also had a side of the seasoned fries with fat sal sauce yummy i will be back to try the more fatty options fat sals has to offer 
glendon is always a great place to go with friends my coworkers and i went for a happy hour celebration and service  food and drinks were great we had a blast
mixed up burger with egg  onion rings  and an extra large orange bangthe end really  youll have a heart attack after this combo but very worth itstill hungry carne asada fries
one of the stars of shack row starving after a lame party with too little liquor and too many douchebags stumbling home from oharasmaloneys seeking comfort latenight postbreakup come to tommy taco for some dreamcometrue fries   is it gourmet streetside food not really is it drool worthy eh what it is is a ucla  westwood landmark that is always there for me when im craving some hot  dirty   cheap junky funk food that flushes every minute i spent sweating at the gym far down the drain yeah i hate myself a little after weve wolfed down a majority of the plate and the fries are limp  cheese is congealed  sour cream curdled  and steak dries up  but those first forkfuls are the guiltiest pleasure even when you are sober and thinking straight
i thought donuts were just donuts before i got a taste of stans now  for better and for worse  i know there is actually a difference in quality yes  its a bit pricey  but i am thankful for that as well otherwise id be spending the money on liposuction anyways satisfying texture with the right amount of sweetness my favorites are the old fashioned buttermilk bar and the pbj flavors will vary by time and day  so come in with your alternate choices lined up
this is my favorite place to eat in westwood affordable  fresh  and delicious any way you want it i love the wowshis because the fillings are baked inside the pita dough and then cut in half blazing hot and feels like you get twice as much food once you fill up each hemi with your choice of veggies and sauces   this is basically a togo spot as there is only a small counter to eat at with about 2 chairs total i do wish there was more seating so i could enjoy my pita more comfortably  but hey  maybe standing aids digestion   heres my protip for the toppings grab a form and open up your pita and make sure all the meatfalafelbeans are spread evenly along one side grab your choices of sauce white sauce  hummus  splash of lemon  hello and drizzle from bottom of the pita to the opening then add your veggies love the pico de gallo this way  you get flavor from top to bottom  not just perched along the rim and watch out  these buggers are juicy make sure to have napkins and maybe even another wax paper to catch all the drippings   awesome theyre open after the bars close  too  because now you can pig out those pint night  amf induced cravings without feeling disgusting or breaking your wallet bella pita is the best
after a 4 month hiatus from westwood  i have returned and had the pleasure of trying out napa valley grille for the first time we came in and sat down at a table near the bar it is definitely a classy establishment by westwood standards and a great place to go if youre trying to avoid the rowdy undergrads our waiter was extremely polite and helpful  knew the background and source of each dish and told us what was popular plenty of organic  local farm produced entrees  if you care about that kind of thing  heres a rundown of what we had sorry i dont remember all the fancy details of each dish  flatbread  14 for a small appetizer seems a little ludicrous  but mmmm was it delicious i was disappointed by the size when it came out however  after splitting half of it with my friend  i was already feeling pretty satisfied   scallops  12 order  again  tiny to the eyes  filling for the tummy two scallops on a bed of mushrooms  greens  and italian baconlike thing i cant name buttery soft juicy glorious   turkey bolognese  12 order  you should have seen the look on my dinner buddys face when he took the first bite pure pleasure need i say more  good food is one thing  but what really pushed me to put that 5th star up there was the service let me quote it back to you  me just water will be fine  thank you waiter would you like a lemon with that me yes  please waiter comes back with water  sans lemon waiter i forgot  did you want lemon with your water me oh  it doesnt really matter ill take it as is waiter no  your happiness is of the utmost importance it is no trouble to me to get you a lemon my first priority is that you are happy  maybe im being a sappy pushover  but when my waiter says that  he can have another 5 on tip and my phone number   it is pricey  but well worth it for the atmosphere  service  and food excellent experience
my husband and i thought the food was fantastic nice ambience and service as well would definitely go back
nom nommmmmmmmmarg argoooohhhhhshould i just keep making primal guttural sounds because these babies are insanely yum yum and cheap 150wow and you get to choose from multiple cookie choices and ice cream choices to make the perfect combo  or just get one cookie and a scoop in a cuplife couldnt get any better unlessyou open one of these in the bay area or they were fat free who cares the cookies were fresh and soft and the ice cream wellmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
anybody growing up in southern california knows innout as a staple  and for good reason  this place has never failed me  and while no one should eat it everyday  i try to go there at least 12 times a month  the service is good  fast  and if you know the secret menu it makes things even better  if you havent tried innout please do  you will not regret it  my uncle once drove from texas to ca to get an innout burger  while it wasnt his only business  it was definitely a reason he stated for coming to ca  always and forever doubledouble animal style  and fries with extra secret sauce
burrito believers  heres the thing  chipotle is where you should pray  for the price  quality  efficiency  it really just doesnt get any better than this   never never never have been disappointed at chipotle  that aluminum wrapped beauty is probably one of the best things i have ever held in my hands  eating the burrito is  of course  an art form  for these burritos are pretty giant sized depending on how much stuff you get they might even double wrap it  no extra charge though cause thats how they roll  heres my exact orderprocess of consumption 1 chicken fajita burrito please 2 just a tiny scoop of extra rice 3 chicken steak is also fantastic  as is carnitas very tender 4 corn salsa a must  medium salsa 5 a little cheese 6 a little sour cream  after you pay only 67 pick up a bottle of chipotle tabasco sauce and drizzle that stuff all over note  it might be smart to cut the burrito in half before eating and save the other half for later  chipotle is also very accommodating to customers  they have a bunch of secret items  like the quesadilla  and also you can also just order 1 taco instead of ordering 3  ask for another tortilla and usually theyll just heat it up for ya at no extra charge   my advice is there is no better bang for your buck than chipotle   oh yeah  their guac  while expensive  will probably make your mouth do the happy dance
how can you not give diddy 5 stars 3 delicious cookies of your choice for 1 custom cookie and ice cream sando for 150 seriously what is not to love you just have to know not to go on certain nights where the line wraps around the block my fav late night treat place in westwood
i love armandos truck he fed me many times while i was at usc the entire reason why i give 5 stars is because of armando who is the nicest person ever this truck puts a smile on my face and thats worth every visit
great  interesting sandwiches  quality soups  really friendly staff all that and its amazingly fast too perfect lunch destination
emmas probably doesnt need yet another review what more can be said about it consistently good  thincrust pizza worth the wait  a cantabrigian institution  everyone likes a certain type of pizza  and im definitely a huge fan of emmas  along with the spicy rosemary sauce its a little pricey for takeout unless youre just grabbing one or two slices  but eatin is a great value there can be a wait sometimesbut once youre seated  you never feel rushed and the people who work there are kind and patient  which just adds to the magic
122307 family of seven for dinner  last night before they closed for the holidays parents are taiwanese  rest of us taiwanese american we enjoyed the food very much  salty crispy chicken  smoked duck taiwanese style authentic  alittle fatty  leave the skinfat on your plate  assorted hot pot with veggies  fish and clams  salt and pepper shrimp ive had better elsewhere  chicken casserole three cup sauce  very good and authentic  chinese veggies dohmeow  sauted fish fillet excellent  shredded pork with baby bamboo big ole plate of bamboo  great taste  even the rice was good   parking tough  grab any street spot you can make reservations  bro says it gets busy during peak periods
122207 oh emma  my how youve stayed the same its been six years since i last saw you  you had just moved to this location from your original home in huron village  back then  you were just a secret your pizzas are still wonderful and light  still so healthy and delicious your menu still hasnt changed much  and youre still popular as ever im glad we had the chance to meet again
i love toscaninis the way i love my mom  unconditionally and forever here was my home for the first few weeks that i lived in central square  a haven of delicious ice cream  hipster approved background music  and free wireless its my favorite goto place for some laptop time   the ice creams unique flavors  be it earl grey  burnt caramel  or any number of flavors is always at the forefront  never diluted by a taste of cream or general sugaryness exactly the way i enjoy my coffee   and i love brunch here too which is uncomplicated and filling i enjoy the creamy egg sandwich
love of my life possibly fire of my loins if i had spilled that hot sauce into my lap but didnt   izzys is sweet and small with a good homey feeling that exudes from their generous  fulfilling plates to their plastic tablecloth covered tables plus they make their own soda too just as sweet but literally  and hello  plantains awesome banana deliciousness
vegetarian alert  jaffa is not only about  shawarma and shishlik  you can get delicious  veggie and vegan plates and wraps here the hummus is creamy and tangy the  baba ganoush is nice and smoky  and the falafel is crunchy and garlicky and not at all oily the owners are friendly and chatty maybe some people dont that  but i do its part of the experience little middle eastern restaurants are supposed to be like that you go there to eat   drink coffee  and talk about whatever  with whomever  and listen to a lot of opinions its all good  and cheap  too we never spend more than 20 for  2  and that includes dessert
im not sure how this is my first review of firestone  i mean ive only been here twice but i think about it often  my fianc introduced me to this place  because cal poly used to be her old stomping grounds  first thing i see when we walk up is a line out of the door  good for business and appearance bad when youre starving  haha but it was well worth the wait  full bar service sports for days on tvs galore and the tritip sandwich  mmmmmmmmmmmmm the tritip sandwich  i find myself trying to recreate the way they smoke the meat and toast the bread  whenever i have extra meat to play with that wasnt supposed to be adult in nature   stop in  eat watch tv get drunk eat some more take some home to eat for dinner  but then eat it an hour later because its that good
id give this place 6 stars if i could  i love me some friendly family business  i love people being glad you were spending your money with them  ahhhh a falafel that is crunchy on the inside and moist and chewy and grainy on the inside  its making my mouth water as we speak  the pita was soo fresh and all the veggies were fresh and full of flavor  the pepperoncini was amazing  we also tasted the gyro meat lamb and beef it was super tasty  not too salty  a bit crispy yet juicy  they had 3 hot sauces which were my style giveem a selection  i like how you pay when your done  might not be a good idea if its crowded but more of a european feel maybe lebanese but i cant speak for them where its more about the food and your time then making sure you pay up front if that make sense  well start with im not into sweets and even less into baklava but damn if i didnt feel like a diabetic needing sugar  i could have eaten 50 of those things they were amazing  bad thing for you  i cant really describe the taste but really really fresh    strange that they are right next to the other med place in town petra  which i would try after frequenting jaffa more but the other place looked just fine
i like fresh  creative friendly affordable places with people that act like they want you therehence the 5 stars   the beer special was 2 which kept me fully  the pizza was way tasty and the location was perfect to people watch  they had a cool vibe and the employees truly were nice and appreciated my patronage    we got 2 slices for there and a 12 to go  both were pepperonimushroom  both the pepperoni and mushrooms were extremely fresh  the sauch had a hint of sweetness  the crust was thin with a nice taste to it
if metropolitan grill in seattle is my number 1 steakhouse in america  john thomas is number 1b everything is good here  from the service to the food every year  my acappella group came here for the senior dinner  and i looked forward to it every year we sat up in the private dining room and virtually every single need of ours was met by the staff they recommended wonderful wines to pair with the prime beef  and gave their honest opinions when asked about things on the menu i live in california so its difficult for me to get to john thomas  but everytime i am in the ole i town  i always make sure to make a visit to john thomas
i lived around the corner from this place for a whole year and never saw it  its away from the normal foot traffic on westwood  gayley  et al  but its really  really good  tasty pizza  their lunch special is pretty good with the salad bar  nice atmosphere  it was never crowded when i went there  but the food is consistently good
great food and one of the best people that ever worked in the restaurant business  get ready to wait in line  cramped spaces and maybe even ready to share your table with a complete stranger  but the food is worth it their dragon roll is great  any sushi is great the student menu is cheap and unlike other asian places very well made  have been going there for a while i dont mind the trek from cmu to oakland to go to this gem  try it once  you wont regret it  youll want to be back there the very next day
i love this place and i always forget about it  its such an adorable spot with great hummustabbouleh and a sinful gyro platter  the best part about it is the outdoor patio  its simply adorned with those soft glowy light bulbs on a string and a bunch of potted plants  a wonderful place to sit with a magnum bottle of byob wine and watch ellsworth go by  the food is flavorful and inexpensive  and the family who runs it is very sweet  i wouldnt necessarily say it was destination dining  but i think anyone who lives in the area would be hard pressed to find a better casual spot to become a regular
i cant stop daydreaming about gather
my boyfriend and i are stuffing our faces with garlic naan and some ridiculously spicy mixed vegetable curry as i draft this review this place is intentionally kitsch and it looks like its having an identity crisis chinese paper lanterns and a pirate ship chandelier inside an antebellum plantation hotel building its like an acid trip  but i wouldnt know because ive never done acid  so im only speculating i probably wouldnt ever come here during the daytime but the food tastes delicious  and at midnight  what more could you want
i literally highfived my boyfriend when we passed by the empty building today  so excited that theyre opening a maoz in berkeley we ate there in january when i visited new york and loved it it was a great value for the price cant wait cant wait cant wait
5 stars go to the 100 organic salad bar and their wide array of vegan offerings yum yummmmm its 10 if you arent a student with a meal plan  but if youre smart you can get a friend to swipe their card for you for a school cafeteria  this is the bees knees
a straightforward cup of drip is handbrewed by pouring very hot water into freshly ground beans into personal cups you couldnt get fresher unless you waited while the beans had been roasted lattes come in insanely mouth watering flavors  for instance the madame x  featuring earl grey infused white chocolate ganache  or even the handsdown winner  atticus finch  that contains vanilla with burnt sugar make no mistake these are no cloying  gimmicky drinks  but rather artful blends subtly kissed with flavor you wont get a speedy cup here and be on your way like perfection takes time
just completed a dinner at charles kitchen in cambridge we stopped in because the smell outside was outstanding we had two different waiters and both were pretty friendly and attentive my friend had the guacamole burger and i had the beef tips  plus an appetizer of clam chowder every little thing was extremely good  in particular the clam chowder and beef tips
have been back several times and just have to say that this is my new favorite cafe im in love the pastries are quite good and the coffee is tasty and reasonably priced  went today for lunch and it was wonderful the salads are highly recommended as is the mint lemonade just go  you will be happy you did
their granola with fruit is top notch  their waffles are delish  we like coming here for dinner since the wait on weekends for brunch is ridonculous  as much as i like my pancakes  im not waiting one friggin hour for them  atmosphere is quirky  eccentric and funwelcome to cambridge friends  usually packed with lots of mit students  which is obvious when you start hearing the folks at the neighboring table start talking about semiconductors  mechanical engineering  and sht  while the service can be inconsistent at times  what can i say  i love this place
oh falafel palacei used to live up the street from fp and ate there maybe 26 timesweek  it is hands down the best value for the  in the area  the food is fresh and delicious and you can tell them exactly how you want it eg extra hot sauce  less falafel more hummus and theyre completely obliging  i especially love the lentil soup  falafel wraps  and foule salad  while the service can be slow at times because it gets so crowded during lunch and dinner hours  for the price  you cant beat moodys
this is  by far  my favorite sandwich shop  and thats saying a lot because quiznos is delicious    these sandwiches are simple  bread  meat  cheese  lettuce  mayo  but they melt in your mouth  the secret is the bread  they have the most delicious loaves ever  just the right amount of flake to the crust while still being incredibly soft on the inside  combine that with the right meat and cheese  and you have eight inches of sandwich perfection  all for just 425 a piece  i love the store itself  too  its clean and attractive  also  every time ive walked into the store  ive found myself nodding and singing along to the music they play  whether its the latest radio hit or an old favorite  but it will always fit into the broad category of rock  the music  the friendly  young  extra hip staff  and the little signs full of attitude all over the store  allow you to pretend for a moment that you are fighting the man by buying a sandwich here
i cant say enough good things about jasons deli  it is so much more than just a sandwich shop  first  the menu is awesome  every single thing ive ever ordered here has been fabulous  my personal favorite is the california club  its turkey  guacamole  bacon  tomato  and sprouts  all inside a croissant  if you dont know what to order  get this one  they also make a mean reuben  if you like reubens  the awesome thing  though  is the extras  first  each meal comes with sides  i always get fruit with this awesome tart yogurtish dip  i enjoy this part of the meal as much as the sandwich  and  you can help yourself to all the little mini muffins you can handle  your choice of honey cornbread or a dark  i dunno  is it bran muffin  both are great  then to top it off  all the free softserve ice cream cones you want  i love the location here  rice village is just a wonderful place to spend time  and this restaurant has a little patio sitting area  but be careful  if you sit outside  never leave your food unattended  the pidgeons have turned into vultures  and will descend on your food the moment you turn your back   however  this is one more great thing about this location  very helpful and friendly staff  when the pidgeons got my lunch  they replaced it for free
this is what ive been missing  no one told me how great toast is wtf  ha  saturday night with a couple yelpies we stopped in here around 1030ish for a small bite and some wine  small bite turned into a cheese plate and the shrimp and grits  i keep thinking about that shrimp and grits dish fantastic  i always picture sloppy breakfast looking grits  is this picture off base  yes  i also enjoyed how the wine is served with choice of the pourgives room to sample  i tried the chianti and it made me warm right up on a chilly night   last but not least the chocolate dessert  just magnificent  the waiter told our table that peeps come in just for that choc dessert  its that good  ill be back
pastries  brownies  doughnuts  breads  cakes  cupcakes  cookies  danishes  muffins  and more  reasonable prices and fresh goodies    today was my first experience at prantis  bf and i walked in and it was packed but the wait was not long before someone asked what we wanted    my eyes darted back and forth trying to pick something  that was a challenge  finally after talking to the counter girl  my bf  and myself i decided to go with a brownie and a cookie  bf picked a doughnut  the bill came to under 4 bucks    the chocolate chip cookie was as thick as a blondie bar but bigger in circumference    the brownie was enormous and has walnuts in it    the doughnut was chocolate and vanilla frosted and my man ate it up within 2 seconds flat    addicting  delicious baked treats  the coffee cakes here with the white powdery stuff on top looked so good  maybe next time
the food is the best bbq ive had in pittsburgh  the meats fall right off the bone and are just so juicy and seasoned well  they have 5 or 6 diff types of bbq sauce all with a little kick  the best side are the black eyed pees  amazing  dont eat inside take it to go
my daughter and i go here all the time she loves the white clam sauce and i love the pizza i have had the lasagna too and loved itthe service is always great too
amazing place  worth the wait one of the best steaks i have ever had the service was excellent and the atmosphere is great the french onion soup and mashed potatoes are amazing too  my son had the tenderloin tips and they were so good great place
had the gnocchi with cream sauce  bruschetta and wine delicious im only sorry i didnt get a chance to revisit this restaurant before i left town didnt get to try the dessert so i cant review that
this place is amazing  at first glance  the food isnt that much different from any other chinese place  except that they have their own farm and grow their own veggies  you wouldnt know from the prices though  its extremely reasonable  especially with the lunch specials  im mildly obsessed with their hot and sour soup  whenever im in the area  i get a large container to go  the bean sprout salads are very fresh  they actually sell their organic bean sprouts in the local super markets  look for chang farms brand   they have a daily specials list when you first walk in its actually what they have from the farm that week
i usually dont like the doughy type of pizza im a new haven thin crust snob  i was hesitant to get a slice  but heard i had to try it  first off  they have an incredible selection  there are specials every day  they have some cool mexican style slices like black bean avocado  the crust is better than it looks  its also open late if youre looking for a quick bite after a late movie or drink  the people who work there can be annoying sometimes and they dont wipe the tables frequently enough  but its easy enough to take it to go or just deal with the crumbs
this is the best chinese in the five college region the ingredients are always fresh and healthy  and the service kind my only complaint is it is a little expensive  but we have been coming here for five years and have a good time  every time i recommend it  especially in the amherst area  and miss it now that we moved in a time where chinese is typically generic  every dish here is a unique spin on the classics
the nice bartender told me that the reubens here are excellent and he highly recommended it  i was hesitant because i never had strong feelings about reuben sandwiches one way or another  i looked over at the woman sitting near me eating her reuben  the appetizer portion  and it looked huge  she said it was the best reuben ever  it peaked my curiosity  so i was torn between getting an asian wrap and a regular size reuben with coleslaw  eventually  i committed to the reuben  but with a bistro side salad instead of coleslaw  as soon as i took a bite of the sandwich  i knew i had made the right choice  the bread was crispy  the pastrami was perfectly seasoned and tender  the cheese and thousand island were just the right amount  it was so darn delicious i didnt want to stop eating  my bistro side salad was very good toofresh greens with glazed walnuts and tomatoes and a light vinaigrette  i managed to control myself and ate only half of the sandwich and took the other half home  i pan grilled the other half the next day and it was still very delicious    i also tasted my friends french onion soup and that was really good too  there were big pieces of onions  lots of cheese  and a rich broth  the service was about a 20 minute wait  our waiter was friendly  overall  a very nice lunch experience
great service  very clean and friendly staff i will return
great food  great prices and i love the lowcalorie options that they give me  the fact that you can order online and not wait to come in and pick up your order makes this a 5 star place
my new favorite yogurt place they have so many selections and a lot of tart selections probably the best yogurt i have had since pinkberry i also love that the business is connected to it the habit burger joint so you can enjoy a tasty burger  then  pick up a yogurt on the way out
absolutely one of the funnest things to do on thursday night in slo town it is packed with fun people  vendors  and tons of good foods if you plan on eating dinner there i recommend the mclintocks booth they bbq amazing beef kabobs and ribs i am sure all there items are delish but i always get the same thing beef kabob  bread drenched in butter  beans  and lemonade its the best meal  just to die for all of the shops on the main stretch are open  along with the hands gallery  one of my favs to hit up i recommend getting there early to get good parking you will have to pay for most slo parking the parking garage is about 75 cents for two hours  not too shabby this is definitely a good time

i swear the tritip sandwiches are bigger than ever and still  just as delicious i picked up two sandwiches before heading back up to san francisco last weekend i told the girl i was driving for 4 hours and she was so nice and helpful she had the cooks wrap up the meat  bread and sauce separately so it wouldnt get soggy during the drive and let me tell you  that night for dinner  it was delicious every bite just remember  always  always get extra bbq sauce theirs is simply the best
i started frequenting pint night tuesdays at dog and duck two years ago i live a couple of blocks away  almost everything on tap is cheaper  the crowds are a good cheerful size  the bartenders are efficient yet helpful and theres always some fun people i have discovered most of my favorite beers at dog and duck under the tutelage of the staff   i have a porch fetish i love sitting outside beer in one hand  cigarette in the other  always an interesting sometimepassionate conversation dog and duck dd has not one but two massive porches one in the front one in the back    pint night was the entirety of my dog and duck experiences for about a year and then  last summer i went to spend a week in south padre with a few friends and that changed quiet a few things   the first was i tried food on the dog and duck menu as a direct result of going to south padre i will get to that story in a bit but in south padre  i also got the most uptight person i know to name my nuts it was a sort of personal challenge judge me all you want  but that poor soul now has an exciting story to share with all her friends for the rest of her life this one time  i went parasailing and i ended up naming my friends nuts i also went parasailing by the way  which was a little uncomfortable what with my fear of heights oh i also slipped through my harness and had a wedgie the entire time i was floating a few hundred feet above that island    back to the dog and duck menu on the way back from padre  we were driving by dog and duck it was open but not very crowded we went in  walked up to the bar and i actually picked up a menu from the pile at the bar that i had always simply and regretfully ignored  they had cheeseburger on the menu i love cheeseburgers so i ordered one  even though the burger and drink cost about 10 but there was nothing cheaper on the menu and the massive burger came with a massive serving of fries ever since  i make a biweekly foodfocused pilgrimage to dog and duck and overwhelmingly usually get a cheeseburger with jalapenos  fries on the side  a dr pepper if its too early or an ipa if its appropriate drinking time dog and duck has by far  the best cheeseburgers ive had in austin yes  better than huts yes  better than p terrys yes  better than sportini   the menu also features other great pub food items on the menu the queso is satisfactory the jalapeno poppers rock my world the fish and chips are good as infamous british food can get    i have taken a lot of friends and especially people from out of town to this almosthidden little gem austin has and theyve always come back for more my brother always makes a stop at dd everytime hes in town now  great staff  great selection of beer  great food  always interesting conversations and two orgasmically good porches dd is a great place to go for a few beers during the week or to satisfy a cheeseburger craving or to just to go for a spontaneous adventure
shalimar is an ode written to the old country in the countrymans native language clay pit on the other hand  is one written in the audiences own familiar language  albeit written with a graceful mastery of the audiences language  by far  the clay pit is not authentic indian but i promise  this lack of strict authenticity is not a bad thing although  retaining a lot of the better elements of indian cuisine  the clay pit has incorporated some elements of afghani and surprisingly american cuisine  with splendid fucking results   with that preamble out of the way  lets get to the food if youre getting appetizers  you need to follow two rules dont get the samosas they are miserable  dry  blandish affairs definitely get the curry crab cakes also dont go to the clay pit if you are not going to be ordering any naan clay pit naan is lifeaffirming and dont just get garlic naan for the love of whatever you hold holy  try the other naans personally i wait for the day the clay pit decides to incorporate elements of fauxitalianslashamerican cuisine and already invent the naan pizza   for the main course  get stuff off of either the specialities of the house or vegetarian delight on the menu  for some easiertopick great fucking food if you dare to venture off of those two choices however  rest assured that most of them explorations will yield something pleasant if you feel like getting the korma  dont get the kabuli chicken instead its basically chicken korma 20 and thank the pretty waitress sarah for the recommendation  the lunch buffet  although a fun experience in its own right  is not the most optimal way to experience the clay pit you owe yourself better than that please   dessert id stick with the kheer everything else is meh however  be aware there is better kheer in austin   i think thats all the information you need to be armed with to enjoy the clay pit for some interesting trivia  keep reading otherwise  make reservations as the place tends to get crowded for dinners or show up for a decent happy hour all appetizers are half off and stick around till dinner okay  trivia starts in the next paragraph   naans are made in an oven made of clay hence  the name incidentally a lot of afghani bread is made in a clay pit before housing the clay pit  the address has housed a brothel and a grocery store as some of austins older residents will still remember  the grocery store that once was also has a horror story that some claim still haunts the clay pit this yelp review however  wouldnt be an appropriate venue to share the story google it
this is a love story  trudys and i met when i was a freshman at ut i had a good first impression of this place it was an late lunch date on a nice thursday afternoon the fish taco touched something at the bottom of my heart  but i did not realize it back then i never really got a chance to know trudys better because as a resident on ut campus i had hundreds of dining dollars i had to spend at school cafeterias  later i fell in love with trudys because of the stuffed avocado with suiza sauce i was infatuated i could not get it out of my mind it was so good that i started taking all my outoftown friendsfamily members here at least once during their stays in austin  then  trudys transformed our relationship to the next level in january of 2006 i remembered that day so well because i turned 21 and i had the first encounter with mexican martini and cuban martini i can only say those are the most pleasurable drinks any restaurants can ever make for me  every time i visit  i discover more things to love about it during my lowcarb period  i learned that their steak fajita salad was of great portion  and with juicy beef strips and crisp vegetable during topshelf tuesdays  trudys encourages me to try out luxuries i normally would not dare to try with the upcoming summer  the additional outdoor seating help reduce the painful longing the socalled dreadful wait time  now trudys and i have a steady relationship i graduated from college  got a job  and practically moved in with the north star location on burnet and 183 it takes me 1 minute to get there we are really really happy
best sports bar around  open and airy with tons of windows i hate the gloomy darkness of most sports bars  loads of tvs  good drink specials and yummy food that steps away from just burgers and fried nonsense the veggie quesadillas are so good the owner  managers and staff are laid back and very friendly and  biggest biggest biggest selling point of all  football  real unadulterated football not that american throw stuff love this place
i do not have the vocabulary to say  the energy to extoll  or the fingercalluses to type how much i love zingermans  fresh baked breads  seas of gourmet cheeses  olives  deli meats  tapenades  pastries  coffees  chocolates holy heck the list goes on and on  and the sandwiches  my goodness  the sandwiches during the inevitable zombie apocalypse on earth  i hope to god i am in ann arbor so i can lock myself in zingermans and at least enjoy good food  even though the doors are glass and zombies will probably just break through them  it would be worth being eaten by zombies to glut myself at zingermans
love  love  love malai kofta korma is my favourite  great as a date place if you get a table downstairs its all rough stone with arched  low ceilings if youre tall youll have to duck  dim lighting  very intimate you will want a reservation on any weekend night  unless you want to wait an hour or more
need a festive place to take a bunch of bulls who dont get along  this is it  by the end of the night you wont know why you were fighting feel like you are a matador being served  and the new chef can really dish it up  the sangria goes down like a transfusion  the paella is worth the wait  if you have a party bring em in at 5pm  and you have the entire country of spain to yourselves  the spanish tortillas drive me crazy with love
i am obsessed with the coffee exchange  their narragansett blend is just great it hits you like a freight train  its unbelievably hot  as if it was brewed in hells percolator  so if youre clumsy  ask them to pour a little out and save yourself an er trip  i love the atmosphere  the coffee and the mini cupcakes however  i do not love this one barista who does not smile  has no customer service skills and has the overall personality of a potato my girlfriend and i come here regularly and have had the misfortune of having her serve us each time her lack of pleasantries makes me want to scream  i digress  the coffee is great  watch out for the ogre barista though
i have been coming to kabob and curry since 2003 i was an indian food initiate who was intimidated at the thought of nuclearhot curry slowly  i made my way through the novice dishes  chicken tikka masala and advanced to more intricately spiced and prepared dishes finally  after sampling literally every single entree on the menu please ask any of the waitstaff if you dont believe me   jai  the manager is unbelievably courteous and goes the extra mile i have watched this restaurant grow and my pallet has grown with it accordingly it has been a favorite for over seven years and i go there around four times a month at minimum and try to bring new people with me as much as possible  just go and eat  seriously
my gf went to undergrad at brown and has known mike for over 5 years  but didnt know hed opened up a new store when we went in and discovered he was the mike of mikes calzones  he gave us free chips  soda and recommended things to put in the calzones  holy  these calzones are good i literally ate here every night for a week straight theyre that good
this place is amazing if youre going for brunch  get the oeuf columbus its amazing  as are their crepes granted  it can be a bit expensive  but its so worth it  also the wait staff is a bit slow sometimes i tend to just order delivery  to avoid that  but if you arent in a rush  then eat in
so good so  so good i lived in nyc for 3 years and never found any falafel that was even close to being this good if i could  id give them 10 stars
love this place awesome waitstaff  delicious food  so amazing i tend to stick to either channa masala or vegetable korma as im a vegetarian  but its always spectacular their naan is great too
i love any boloco  this one  the boston ave one  and the berklee one theyre not overpriced  and if youre looking for something mexicaneque while not too big on feeling like your insides are melting  youre better off here than someplace like annas their summer wrap is pure quality  and smoothies fuck  i missed the last bus home until 1am they close at 11 one night because i was craving a mango smoothie after a hot 30mi bike ride
coconut rice has become a consistent part of my diet thanks to vp   i have never gone here outside of a passim show  but i would recommend you stick around for a lovely folk set   most recently they were without a pizza oven i believe they have one working by now and they serve sandwiches on iggys bread instead it was a damn good idea  i kind of wish theyd keep that on the menu their peanut curry dish turned into a sandwich was a unique  delicious new option
i feel like i dont even need to review this place im a vegan as of the past few months and ive gotten quite used to oh  that looks delicious but i guess i cant eat it or oh  i guess ill just have them leave out the x  y  and z and im also allergic to soymilk just the milk so usually vegan ice cream is not an option either  i experience none of the above here everything is delicious and flavorful  either vegan or easily veganized  and filling it wont be quite as healthy as life alive  but i dont do yoga often enough to want to spend all my time there their coffee is decent as well  and they have pumpkin ice cream and all their ice creams are coconut milk based  which is fantastic  only quip is that they dont serve pizza on the menu they tell you that if you want pizza  go to their sister in harvard sq i say  either serve it or dont mention it at all dont tease us
yelp keeps telling me to review this place since i checked in like  months ago for some reason forgive me if my review sucks  the things i remember most about the place   the interior decor was fantastic  great date atmosphere  and i remember seeing a closed off private group room that looked really cool  service was pretty quick it wasnt that crowded  but for a sushi restaurant it was impressive  i dont think there was anything wrong with my roll i got a special of some kind  it was fancy  pretty  and made my mouth happy it was kind of a spontaneous date and i remember taking pretty pictures there but managed to have them all disappear from existence  2 blogs  2 hard drives and all damn
i love this place way better than felipesannas   the summer and mediterranean burritos are amazing  whoever invented  mango salsa is a god
love does not begin to explain my feelings for daedalus   it is  by far  my favourite restaurant in harvard square    the highlight of the restaurantbar is the rooftop deck  there is no better place to be on beautiful summer day    the menu is excellent  i am a big fan of their fish and chips not greasy  waiters and management are top notch   while they have a good selection of beers  they no longer serve newcastle on tap which makes me tear up just a little  i guess you cant have your cake and eat it too
more please  before i went to school at cal  i hated mexican  then i discovered la burrita  aka labo  food  the carne asada wet burrito enough said  service  fast  friendly  ambiance  quaint little place to have a bite to eat  and they have a nice little patio in the back  overall  go
i love this place  you can get precooked dogs and buns to go  throw them on the grill on a sunday if you dont feel like going all the way out to berkeley  food  perfectly toasted buns and juicy wieners make my mouth water  service  fast  ambiance  its a small place thats always packed  but hey  who doesnt want a portable yummy treat  overall  best dogs in the bay area
i love this place seriously the best burritos i can find in the area  they have a whole range of choices  to the point they even have a philly cheese steak burrito  i recommend this one  they have amazing combo meals as well   the decor is whatever and theres a usually a line  who cares  i love their food
when you want some good chinese food  this place is awesome well  the place is called vietnam village  but it basically serves what i know as chinese food haha the owner is super nice the service is fast the food is cheap because the portions are huge its like 3 servings perserving thats awesome
ohhh sooo good i literally went here everyday for an entire week  when i first found out about it the philly cheese steaks are amazing dont bother getting it with mushrooms  because you end up paying extra money for like 5 slices of mushroom also make sure you get it with cheez whiz yeah  i know  i was wary of it too  but i decided to give it a go  and wow  it makes a difference they also offer american and provolone  but neither of them stand a chance against the whiz they also have a little pepper bar  with different kinds of peppers  i usually get the big jalapeno slices  but dont add too many theyre arent spicy at all  but it takes away from the flavor of the meatcheesebread if you want spice  i recommend some sriracha sauce on that steak  it adds the perfect kick just know that i am extremely biased towards sriracha sauce haha  ive also had the crispy chicken sandwich which was equally as good as the cheese steak for days when you feel like something different its like a high quality version of the tendercrisp at bk dont let that description steer you away  cuz it really is good it comes on hoagie bread with a huge slab of freshly fried chicken  mayo  lettuce  tomatos  and onions  also  do not  i repeat  do not forget to get some garlic fries they are so good for only 2 you get an entire box full 50 extra for ranch  which i say is a must have with garlic fries  this place is also one of the very few places in berkeley that actually takes discover yay they also take amex for those of you who like to use that  make sure you dont around lunch time  cuz it is packed  you cant move an inch without bumping into at least 6 people ive found that the best time is to go around 2 or 3pm  when its completely empty
